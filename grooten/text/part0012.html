<p class="chap1"><b class="calibre1">Weak pawns</b></p>
<p class="level"><b class="calibre1">7.1 Introduction</b></p>
<p class="noindent">In a chess game, the movements of the pieces are largely determined by the pawn structure. We can regard the pawn skeleton as the backbone of the position, on which everything else is hung. It is as if the pawns indicate on which files the rooks should be placed, where the pieces should go, and also where they have no business.</p>
<p class="noindent">There is yet another important detail that we can read from the positions of the pawns, namely where the weaknesses are situated. A diagram may serve to clarify this.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00186.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="level"><b class="calibre1">7.2 Definitions</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Let us formulate these features into a practical concept:</p>
<p class="noindent"><b class="calibre1">Definition:</b></p>
<p class="noindent">A backward pawn is a pawn standing on a half-open file, which cannot be protected by its pawn colleagues, and also has no pawn colleagues next to it. This makes the square in front of this pawn weak, and the opponent can take firm control of it.</p>
<p class="noindent">Therefore, a backward pawn is a major source of concern, but there are also other kinds of pawns that we call weak. In the following diagram it is not hard to point out several weaknesses.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00187.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="indentv">A) A protected passed pawn (a4) is in principle a strong pawn, and especially in pawn endings it is a lethal weapon.</p>
<p class="indentv">B) An isolated pawn in the centre (d4) is principally weak, since it can easily be attacked by the opponent. However, in many positions it functions as a means of attack, since the pieces can be arranged behind it and the pawn controls important strong-points in the centre.</p>
<p class="indentv">C) A pawn on a (half-)open file is in principle a target, since it cannot expect any support from its ‘little brothers’. Still, there is always the hope that it can be pushed forward and, as a result, free itself from its status (in the diagram position Black hopes to achieve the push …f6-f5, after which he will have solved the weakness on f6). The pawn on b4 is not on an open file, but nevertheless it can become a prey for the enemy minor pieces, since it is more or less fixed, and its immobility makes it a target.</p>
<p class="indentv">D) The plight of the backward pawn (h3) is in principle the worst. It has no support; and pushing it forward is practically impossible, since the opponent controls the square in front of it.</p>
<p class="noindent">From the above argument we can conclude that pawns on half-open files can be regarded as potential weaknesses. Between them, the backward pawn is most in need of support.</p>
<p class="noindent">Let’s have a look at an example from practice.</p>
<p class="game2t"><a id="ch7level1" class="calibre3"></a>Hans-Joachim Hecht</p>
<p class="game1"><a id="ch7level2" class="calibre3"></a>Gyözö Forintos</p>

<p class="image"><img src="../images/00188.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="noindent">In the diagram position, the black pawns on c6 and d6 are on half-open files for White. At first sight, Black does not seem to be in bad shape. His pawns do not look weak yet, and in certain circumstances they could even be moved forward. Now it is up to White to make sure that this does not happen, and that the defending pieces are eliminated. This explains the following action:</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">1.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>g5!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">A very strong move – much better than the obvious 1.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xe7+. White has correctly seen that his knight is doing a good job on the outpost f5, accentuating the weakness of – especially – the d-pawn.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">1…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>fd8 2.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>c1</b></p>
<p class="noindent">2.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>c2 also deserved consideration.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">2…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>ac8</b></p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00189.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">3.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>c3!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">A multi-functional move. White is ready to prepare a doubling or even a tripling on either the d- or the c-file. Obviously White does not exchange on e7 himself, leaving it up to his opponent to do this. By the way, 3.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>e3 would also have achieved the same aim.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">3…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xg5</b></p>
<p class="noindent">With the text move Black activates the white cavalry, but the alternative 3…h6?! was even worse. White would achieve a huge advantage with 4.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xe7 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>xe7 5.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>d3 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>xf5 6.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xe5.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">4.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xg5</b></p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00190.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">4…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>f4</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Black realizes that he cannot survive by normal means. After 4…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>e7 5.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xf7 <span class="chessfont">♔</span>xf7 6.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xe7 <span class="chessfont">♔</span>xe7 his king is, as it were, drawn to the unsafe centre, after which White has various methods to obtain a huge advantage (the best possibility after 6…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xe7 seems to be 7.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xc6! <span class="chessfont">♖</span>xc6 8.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>d5+, and White wins a crucial pawn): 7.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>h5 h6 8.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>g3 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>g8 (after 8…<span class="chessfont">♔</span>f8 9.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>ee3!, the white initiative is killing) 9.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>h4+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>e8 and now both 10.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>d1 and 10.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>g6 are virtually winning.</p>
<p class="noindent">Another possibility is 4…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>e8, but after 5.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>g4 d5 6.h4 d4 7.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>c5, the black formation has also become weak. The protected passed pawn on d4 does not balance this disadvantage, since White exerts enormous pressure on the kingside (and also on the e5-pawn).</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">5.g3 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>h5</b></p>
<p class="noindent">There was no longer anything reasonable to be found. After 5…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>e6 6.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xf7 <span class="chessfont">♔</span>xf7 7.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>d3, things would get out of hand for Black, as a pawn is lost: 7…d5 8.exd5 cxd5 9.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xe5. Black turns out to succumb to the weakness of his centre pawns. After the text move, by the way, the game is over too.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">6.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>d2 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>e6 7.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xe6 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>xe6</b></p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00191.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">8.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>g5</b></p>
<p class="noindent">And Black resigned in view of the triple threat of 9.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xg7#, 9.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xh5 and 9.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>e7+. It was striking how much trouble Black turned out to have with his pawns in this game. With a few well-aimed ‘shots’, White was able to ruin the black stronghold.</p>
<p class="level"><b class="calibre1">7.3 Manoeuvring against weak pawns</b></p>
<p class="noindent">It is not usual for the weakness of one or more pawns to be exposed in just a few moves’ time. The player who possesses such an advantage often has to manoeuvre quite cautiously, and only in the distant future will he be able to reap the fruits of a well-conducted strategy.</p>
<p class="noindent">It is known that a backward pawn on a half-open file first has to be carefully blocked before it can be targeted. The reason for this is simple: the superior side wants the weakness to be fixed as deeply as possible inside the opponent’s camp, so that the latter will also suffer from a dire lack of space. In the following fragment we see how gradually the winning process develops.</p>
<p class="game2t"><a id="ch7level4" class="calibre3"></a>Boris Spassky</p>
<p class="game1"><a id="ch7level5" class="calibre3"></a>Yury Averbakh</p>
<p class="game2"><a id="ch7level6" class="calibre3"></a>Kharkov 1963</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00192.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="noindent">In this position, White has the superior pawn structure. The pawn on d4 will fall into his hands shortly, after which Black is saddled with the weakness of d6.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">1.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xf6 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>xf6 2.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xd4 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>e5</b></p>
<p class="noindent">To 2…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>c5, 3.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>c1 is presumably the best reply. White brings his last piece into the game and maintains the pressure on Black’s position.</p>
<p class="noindent">To 2…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>b7, 3.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>f5 is a strong answer. White exchanges his b2-pawn for the d6-pawn with 3…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xb2 4.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xd6, which, after 4…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>c5 5.e5, leads to a very promising position. The white pieces are cooperating well, whereas any coordination between Black’s pieces is completely lacking. Also, the black king position is lying bare, and therefore an attack on the king wouldn’t be appearing out of thin air.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">3.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>b3 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>d7 4.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>c1</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Looking at the further course of the game, we could ask ourselves whether the immediate 4.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>d2 should not have been preferred. After 4…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>ac8 5.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>ad1, White has an extra tempo compared to the game.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">4…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>ac8 5.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>d2 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>g6</b></p>
<p class="noindent">In view of the comment to the previous move, 5…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xc1 would have been more natural. After 6.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xc1 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>c8, 7.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>d1 is the customary continuation.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00193.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">6.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>cd1!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">An instructive move. To be able to put pressure on a weak pawn, White is helped by keeping the heavy pieces on the board. If we had only minor pieces on the board in this position, then White’s advantage would be virtually negligible.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">6…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>e5?!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Black would have done better to activate his king’s rook with 6…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>fe8.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">7.f4</b></p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00194.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">7…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>c4</b></p>
<p class="noindent">A quite obvious move, but the question is whether the exchange of the white bishop for this knight is so advantageous for Black. However, the alternatives did not look very rosy either. After 7…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>c6?!, White would exchange one advantage for another with 8.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xc6 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>xc6 9.e5 dxe5 10.fxe5 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>e7 11.e6 f6. Now he has eliminated Black’s weakness, but the white passed pawn is incredibly strong, and with 12.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>d7! he demonstrates that the position already contains a combination. A possible continuation is 12…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>fe8 13.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>c1!, and White wins a decisive amount of material.</p>
<p class="noindent">It looks as if 7…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>g6 is still playable, but then White would obtain a large positional advantage with 8.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>e2!. He then threatens 9.e5, and on 8…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>c6 White would cash in a pawn with 9.f5! <span class="chessfont">♘</span>e5 10.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xd6 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>xd6 11.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xd6.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">8.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xc4 bxc4</b></p>
<p class="noindent">This is no bed of roses for Black, as he is saddled with a new weakness. Moreover, his bishop has become bad.</p>
<p class="noindent">After 8…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xc4, Black would also have been in big trouble: 9.b3 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>c7 10.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>f3 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>c6 11.e5, and the weak pawn already falls into White’s hands. The tactical trick 11…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>g6 12.exd6 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>c2 (12…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xh3? 13.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>e5) is refuted by 13.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>h4! <span class="chessfont">♖</span>xd2 14.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xg6 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>xd1 15.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>e7+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>h8 16.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xd1, and White wins.</p>
<p class="noindent">After the text move Black is left with a destroyed pawn structure.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00195.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">9.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>e2!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">A clever move. White plays the knight to the beautiful square c3, where it will fix the pawn on c4 and control the square d5. Also, the d-file is opened, so the pressure on d6 can be increased.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">9…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>a4</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Keeping the damage within bounds.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">10.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>c1 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>fd8 11.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>c3 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>c6 12.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>cd1 h6</b></p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00196.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">13.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>e3!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">This move emphasizes that there is nothing left to do for Black. White can take his time to increase the pressure on the d6-pawn, and in the meantime he centralizes his queen, which can later keep an eye on the d6-pawn from g3.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="vel413" class="calibre3"></a>By leaving the d-file with his queen, Spassky also makes a doubling of rooks on this file possible.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">13…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>b8 14.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>e2 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>bc8 15.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>d4 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>b7 16.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>ed2 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>e7 17.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>g3 <span class="chessfont">♔</span>f8</b></p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00197.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">18.f5!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">In a higher sense, this move decides the game. Although White marks his own pawn on e4 as a backward pawn, the attack on the weak d6-pawn can no longer be dealt with. Thus, 18…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>c6 is met by 19.e5, and now it becomes clear why the presence of the major pieces works in White’s favour. The pressure on the d-file will be Black’s undoing.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">18…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>e8 19.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xd6</b></p>
<p class="noindent">The first harvest is gathered.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">19…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>e5</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Black seeks refuge in an endgame, hoping that he will be able to save a half point there. 19…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xe4 20.f6! gxf6 21.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>e2 would also have been disastrous for him.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">20.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xe5 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>xe5 21.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>2d4 a5 22.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>b6 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>a8 23.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>a6 <span class="chessfont">♔</span>e8 24.<span class="chessfont">♔</span>f2 <span class="chessfont">♔</span>f8 25.<span class="chessfont">♔</span>e3 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>ec5</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Now that White has stabilized his central position, he can start a search for new advantages.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00198.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">26.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>d7</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Also not bad was 26.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>a4!, winning at least a second pawn: 26…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>5c6 (26…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>b5 27.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>b6) 27.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xa5 or also 27.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xc6.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">26…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>c6 27.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>da7 a4</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Black’s problems are piling up. Besides the fact that he is a pawn down, his queenside pawns must move to squares of the wrong colour, making the dark squares available to the white pieces.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">28.<span class="chessfont">♔</span>d4 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>e8 29.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>b6</b></p>
<p class="noindent">It is remarkable that White is not interested in a four-rook endgame with two extra pawns after 29.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xa4 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>xa4 30.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xa4; probably because Black could then develop a small trace of counterplay with 30…c3, even though objectively it does not promise him much.</p>

<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">37…f6+ 38.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xf6!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Of course. The last remains of Black’s protective wall are mopped up.</p>

<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">21…c6?</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Just what White was waiting for. In an attempt to bring his bishop pair to life, Black opens up the position. He does not realize that from now on he will be stuck with a weak pawn on an open file, while White obtains control of the strong d5-square as well (see also Chapter 9).</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">22.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>c4 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>c7 23.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>g4</b></p>

<p class="noindent">In the middlegame, White has managed to shatter the black pawn formation. These weaknesses are felt most strongly in the endgame, which is why Giri has simplified into this position.</p>
<p class="noindent">For the moment, it is not easy to make progress. The black bishop controls the invasion square of the white rook, and the black king is protecting all the weaknesses. Giri proceeds here according to the famous ‘don’t hurry’ principle. First, he has to bring his own king into the game.</p>

<p class="noindent">You could call this a minor success for Black, since a white pawn has been fixed on a square of an unfavourable colour. However, in this case we will see that a pawn that has advanced so far can become a significant factor anyway.</p>

<p class="noindent"><a id="ch7inlevel2" class="calibre3"></a>Black is still saddled with a vulnerable pawn structure, and rather passively placed pieces. White can boast a healthy formation and much more active pieces. And yet, it is still hard to make progress. For the time being, Black has protected everything, and it is not easy for White to enter the black position with his pieces. Something special needs to be found – and Giri finds it!</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">39.g4!</b></p>

<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">39…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>d8</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Black wants to confront the invaded white rook. The exchange of rooks would only favour Black. The pawn on b6 could become an easy target in that case. Of course, the question is why White puts a beautiful pawn on offer. The answer is that after 39…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xh4, he plays 40.g5, and now Black has to be very careful not to lose his bishop: 41.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>h8 is threatened, winning a piece.

<p class="noindent">The bishop has to retreat to this bad square. More important, it has been driven off the long diagonal, where it fulfilled such an important function. Apart from the fact that it defended g7, the white king could never enter via e5 either.</p>

<p class="noindent">Thus, Black loses g7, and White gets two very strong passed pawns.

An illustrative line is 50…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>h8 51.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>d7 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>b8 52.f5, with the idea that 52…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>e5 runs into the same move: 53.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>f4 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>xf4 54.<span class="chessfont">♔</span>xf4, and Black is doomed.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">50.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>f2?!</b></p>

Granted, White’s king and bishop are pushed back a long way, but after 52.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>d2 there is no way for Black to stop the strong pawns.
