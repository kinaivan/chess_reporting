<p class="chap1"><b class="calibre1">Weakened king position</b></p>
<p class="level"><b class="calibre1">5.1 Introduction</b></p>
<p class="noindent">The purpose in chess is to give mate to the enemy king. This is a truism, but it is less obvious that this goal is sometimes closer at hand than we would expect.</p>
<p class="noindent">In the previous chapter we saw an example from the Romantic Era, when chess players went for the enemy king’s throat from move one. In this example we could see that the king may become a target already in the early middlegame if it lacks sufficient protection. For grandmasters, the safety of their king is an important factor. Sometimes a player is forced to allow a weakening of his king position with an unfavourable exchange. In other cases, the weakening can be forced by an (unexpected) piece sacrifice. In this chapter we will look at various examples where the opponent’s king is exposed to an attack by enemy pieces, caused by the destruction of its protective cordon for one reason or another. In all these cases we witness the same process: a breach is made in the defensive wall that the king has put up in front of itself. We can compare it to a medieval castle where a hole is made in the wall with a battering-ram. As soon as the passage is created, the attackers storm in through the hole and try to take possession of the area behind it. Chess isn’t any different. With a sacrifice, a breach is made in the protective pawn cordon, and as a consequence your pieces can enter through the hole and obtain free play against the unfortunate enemy monarch.</p>
<p class="noindent">To keep things clear, we will make a division. In 5.2 we will discuss the king in the centre of the board; and in 5.3 the castled king will be dealt with.</p>
<p class="noindent">In practice, a king in the centre will generally be an easier target for the enemy pieces than a castled king. However, in these sections we will discuss castled positions where the holes are already clearly visible.</p>
<p class="level"><b class="calibre1">5.2 King in the centre</b></p>
<p class="noindent">The player who neglects the development of his pieces will not infrequently get his king into trouble. After all, the preparation of castling, bringing the king into (temporary) safety, is an essential part of development. Therefore it is not so surprising that such underdeveloped positions can be forced open by violent means.</p>
<p class="noindent">The following fragments are characteristic illustrations of this theory.</p>

<p class="noindent">Despite his material advantage, Black has great problems. His pieces do not coordinate and his king is stuck in a draughty centre.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">1.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xe5+! dxe5 2.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xe5+ <span class="chessfont">♗</span>e7</b></p>

Of course, 2…<span class="chessfont">♔</span>d7 will end badly for Black as well, since his king is in the line of fire of virtually all of White’s pieces: 3.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>f5+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>e8 4.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xf7+ <span class="chessfont">♕</span>xf7 5.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xc8# is the most accurate winning line.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">3.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>c6+!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">With this ‘diversion’ White forces the mate.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">3…<span class="chessfont">♔</span>f8</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Or 3…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xc6 4.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xe7#.</p>

<p class="rights"><b class="calibre1">1-0</b></p>
<p class="noindent1"><a id="vel166" class="calibre3"></a>Of Bobby Fischer we know that he had great admiration for the play of his compatriot Paul Morphy. The efficiency and the logic with which Morphy took on many of his opponents appealed to his imagination. If we compare Morphy’s game from the previous chapter with the following fragment, we discover several striking similarities.</p>
<p class="game2t"><a id="ch5level4" class="calibre3"></a>Robert Fischer</p>
<p class="game1"><a id="ch5level5" class="calibre3"></a>Miguel Najdorf</p>

<p class="image"><img src="../images/00115.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="noindent">White has a substantial advantage in development. Since the black king is still in the centre, the following exchange sacrifice (analogous to several games by Morphy) is fully justified.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">1.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xe4! dxe4 2.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>f5</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Better than 2.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>b3, which gives Black chances of survival after 2…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>b6 3.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xf7+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>d8.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">2…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>c5</b></p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00116.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">3.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>g7+</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Quite instructive! The purpose of this move is solely to make castling impossible for Black, and then to continue the attack with renewed vigour.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">3…<span class="chessfont">♔</span>e7</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Now, 3…<span class="chessfont">♔</span>f8 is worse in view of 4.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>h6 <span class="chessfont">♔</span>g8, and with the elegant queen switch 5.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>b3 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>f8 6.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>f5, followed by <span class="chessfont">♕</span>g3+, White immediately decides the game in his favour.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">4.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>f5+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>e8</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Now White must think of a way to breathe new life into his attack. Of course, he begins by activating as quickly as possible his two pieces that are still on their original squares.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">5.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>e3</b></p>
<p class="noindent">This move has the important secondary aim of trading off Black’s active bishop.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">5…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xe3</b></p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00117.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">6.fxe3!</b></p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="vel167" class="calibre3"></a>Active pieces are best left where they are. We can also learn this from Morphy, who was always aiming to increase the activity of his pieces. The knight is very dominant on f5. The exchange of the dark-squared bishops creates the threat of <span class="chessfont">♘</span>d6+.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">6…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>b6 7.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>d1</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Now White’s last piece has been activated. Incidentally, here 7.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xf7+ would also have sufficed to reach a winning position, for example: 7…<span class="chessfont">♔</span>d8 8.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>d1 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>a7 9.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>a3!, and not only is the black king particularly unsafe, his pieces do not cooperate either.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">7…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>a7 8.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>d6 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>d8</b></p>
<p class="noindent">The best defence under the circumstances, although Black is already fighting a losing battle.</p>
<p class="noindent">Things would have gone terribly wrong after 8…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xb2 9.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xf7+:</p>
<p class="indentv">A) If Black chooses 9…<span class="chessfont">♔</span>d8 here, analogously to what happens further on in the game, he will be immediately taken out with 10.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>a5+! <span class="chessfont">♔</span>c8 (10…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>c7 also leads to disaster after 11.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>e6 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>b5 12.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xd7+ <span class="chessfont">♕</span>xd7 13.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xd7 <span class="chessfont">♔</span>xd7 14.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>d5+) 11.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>e7+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>b8 12.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>c6+, and the roof comes crashing down;</p>
<p class="indentv">B) 9…<span class="chessfont">♔</span>xf7 brings about an elegant conclusion: 10.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xd7+ <span class="chessfont">♖</span>xd7 11.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xd7+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>g6 12.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>g7+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>xf5 13.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>g4#.</p>

<p class="noindent">Nothing can save Black, for instance: 9…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>f8 10.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>g7+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>e7 11.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>a3.</p>

<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">10.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xf7+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>d8</b></p>
<p class="noindent">After 10…<span class="chessfont">♔</span>f8 11.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>h5, mate is inevitable. An elegant line is 11…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>b6 12.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>f7+! <span class="chessfont">♕</span>xf7 13.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>d8+ <span class="chessfont">♕</span>e8 14.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xe8#.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">11.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>e6</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Black resigned, since the pin will be his undoing. A possible continuation is: 11…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>b7 12.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>d5 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>c8 13.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>a5+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>e8 14.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xa6, and the many threats are too much for Black to handle.</p>
<p class="noindent1">There has been another World Champion who knew a thing or two about driving the enemy king into a tight corner.</p>
<p class="game2t"><a id="ch5level7" class="calibre3"></a>Elmar Magerramov</p>
<p class="game1"><a id="ch5level8" class="calibre3"></a>Garry Kasparov</p>
<p class="game2"><a id="ch5level9" class="calibre3"></a>Baku 1977</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00121.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="noindent">At first sight, White is not doing so badly. Black has an isolated pawn on d5 that needs support, and besides, the black pieces do not seem to radiate much activity. But this is a very static way of looking at the position. The dynamic factors speak in Black’s favour. In particular, there is the fact that the white king is still in the middle, and he still has to develop his bishop too. These factors turn out to be of overriding importance. Kasparov does not hesitate to make a promising pawn sacrifice:</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">1…d4!? 2.exd4</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Also after 2.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>e2 things go wrong for White, as the following variation illustrates: 2.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>e2 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>g5 3.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xd4 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>xd4 4.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xd4 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>ad8, and Black has taken over the initiative.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">2…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>e8 3.f3</b></p>
<p class="noindent">White acts dumb, but already his problems are enormous. For instance, he cannot develop smoothly: 3.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>e2 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>xg2, and the principled 3.d5 fails to 3…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>f4+ 4.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>e2 (neither does 4.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>e2 help after 4…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xd5!) 4…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xg2+ 5.<span class="chessfont">♔</span>f1 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>d7!, after which Black’s attack has taken on decisive proportions already, for example: 6.<span class="chessfont">♔</span>xg2? <span class="chessfont">♕</span>g5+ 7.<span class="chessfont">♔</span>f1 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>h3+ 8.<span class="chessfont">♔</span>e1 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>g2, winning.</p>
<p class="noindent">Playing the text move, White is not afraid of a discovered check by the knight, and neither does he fear 3…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>h4+?! 4.g3 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>f6 5.<span class="chessfont">♔</span>f2, after which he will be more or less OK. But he is in for a nasty surprise.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00122.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">3…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xf3!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">An unexpected and quite unusual piece sacrifice. As we have also seen in earlier examples, the attacker by force removes a piece from the protective cordon around the enemy king, making it possible for his remaining pieces to besiege the latter. The hiding-place on f2 that White had in mind becomes extremely draughty after the text move. The following moves are more or less forced.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">4.gxf3 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>h4+ 5.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>f2 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>xd4+ 6.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>e2 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>xf3+ 7.<span class="chessfont">♔</span>f1 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>h3+ 8.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>g2 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>h4?!</b></p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="vel28" class="calibre3"></a>Remarkably, Kasparov misses the best continuation of the attack. The 13th World Champion was famous for his ability to add force to his attacks by optimally involving all his pieces. He should have done that here with 8…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>ad8! 9.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>c1 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>d2+ 10.<span class="chessfont">♔</span>g1 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>e3+ 11.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>f2 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>d6, and the threat of …<span class="chessfont">♖</span>g6 is lethal.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">9.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>g1 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>ad8 10.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>e1?</b></p>
<p class="noindent">White collapses under the continuous pressure. The only chance of salvation was offered by 10.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>a4!, as Kasparov has indicated himself, but also in that case Black would have had splendid winning chances by 10…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xg2 11.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xg2 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>e5 (11…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>e3 also looks very promising for Black) 12.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>g4 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>xg4 13.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xg4 f5 14.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>f3 g5.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">10…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>d3! 11.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>f2</b></p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00123.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">11…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>f3!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">White’s pieces find themselves in a kind of positional zugzwang.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">12.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>h1</b></p>
<p class="noindent">After 12.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xd3, 12…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xh2 is mate. 12.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>d5 is met by the elegant 12…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>d1+ 13.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xd1 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>xh2#; and 12.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>g3 does not allow White to hold after 12…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>d2+ 13.<span class="chessfont">♔</span>e1 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>xg3 14.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xg3 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>f3+ 15.<span class="chessfont">♔</span>f2 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>xg1.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">12…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>ee3</b></p>
<p class="noindent">12…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>de3 was even more powerful.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">13.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>g1 <span class="chessfont">♔</span>h8 14.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>h1 b5</b></p>
<p class="rights"><b class="calibre1">0-1</b></p>
<p class="noindent">A pretty final move. The white knight cannot avoid being driven away, as 15.a3 is met by 15…a5 and 16…b4, after which the threat of 17…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xe2 decides the game.</p>
<p class="level"><b class="calibre1">5.3 The castled king</b></p>
<p class="noindent">In this section we will look at various castled positions that are either seriously weakened or wrenched out of joint by a characteristic sacrifice. In the mating attack that follows, the attacker disposes of various tactical means, which are instructive to watch. Again we divide the material:</p>
<p class="level"><b class="calibre1">* Already weakened</b></p>
<p class="noindent">If in a king position the pawns are not aligned neatly before the king like a protective layer, we speak of a weakened position. The lack of a natural defensive structure allows the enemy pieces to attack the king.</p>
<p class="noindent">We can distinguish a well-known type of combination in the following position.</p>
<p class="game2t"><a id="ch5level10" class="calibre3"></a>Robert Fischer</p>
<p class="game1"><a id="ch5level11" class="calibre3"></a>Pal Benko</p>
<p class="game2"><a id="ch5level12" class="calibre3"></a>New York ch-USA 1963 (10)</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00124.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="ch5inlevel2" class="calibre3"></a>Obviously, the weak point in Black’s king position is h7. However, in the event that White opens the d3-h7 diagonal with 1.e5, Black has planned a nice response: 1…f5!, when White has no time to take this pawn en passant, since his queen is hanging. In order to prevent this defence, Fischer came up with an elegant move:</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">1.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>f6!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">This combination is known in chess literature as a blockading sacrifice.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">1…<span class="chessfont">♔</span>g8</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Black cannot take the rook under penalty of immediate mate (1…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xf6 2.e5), while the rook is doing a good job on the f6-square.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">2.e5 h6 3.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>e2!</b></p>
<p class="rights"><b class="calibre1">1-0</b></p>
<p class="noindent">The most precise move. White saves his knight, while threatening both 4.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xd6 and 4.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xh6. By the way, the black knight cannot budge in view of 4.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>f5, with inevitable mate.</p>
<p class="level"><b class="calibre1">* Weakening by means of a sacrifice</b></p>
<p class="noindent">In order to dismantle the ‘natural protective cordon’ described above, now and then violent means need to be applied. This almost invariably involves a combination with a more or less forced character. The sacrifices must be accepted, as otherwise the opposite side is left with a second defect in his position. The following case is quite instructive.</p>
<p class="level"><b class="calibre1">Fragment 01 / Pin</b></p>
<p class="noindent">The following classic combination is thematic and, as such, has been featured in various books. Here I will give just one version.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00125.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="noindent">Black’s king position contains a gaping hole, but this doesn’t seem to be such a problem, since White does not have many pieces in the attack and Black can defend with the simple …<span class="chessfont">♔</span>h8 followed by …<span class="chessfont">♖</span>g8 and …<span class="chessfont">♖</span>g7. Still, the position contains a slightly hidden combinational motif, allowing White to emerge victorious:</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">1.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>g4+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>h8 2.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>h4</b></p>
<p class="noindent">The point becomes clear. The typical defence 2…f5 is now impossible, since the black queen is unprotected. By playing the queen to h4, White introduces a pin that guarantees him the win.</p>
<p class="level"><b class="calibre1">Fragment 02 / <span class="chessfont">♗</span>xh7+</b></p>
<p class="game2t"><a id="ch5level13" class="calibre3"></a>Vladimir Potkin</p>
<p class="game1"><a id="ch5level14" class="calibre3"></a>Alexander Suslin</p>
<p class="game2"><a id="ch5level15" class="calibre3"></a>Moscow rapid 2012 (2)</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00126.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="noindent">We can spot several features that enable White to successfully crash through the black king’s position. The most important thing is that he has driven the defending knight from f6 by playing his e-pawn to e5, and often this is the signal for the famous ‘standard sacrifice’:</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">13.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xh7+! <span class="chessfont">♔</span>xh7</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Declining the sacrifice doesn’t come into consideration, for after 13…<span class="chessfont">♔</span>h8 14.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>g5 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>d7 15.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>h5, Black can pack it in as well.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">14.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>g5+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>g6</b></p>
<p class="noindent">After 14…<span class="chessfont">♔</span>g8, White continues 15.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>h5, after which mate can only be prevented at the cost of the queen. The attempt to make space for his own king is punished in an instructive manner: 15…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xa3 16.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xf7+ (first White takes this pawn ‘for free’.

<p class="noindent"><a id="vel446" class="calibre3"></a>Once more, White takes aim at the weakest point in the enemy position: pawn f7. This is nicely in keeping with Steinitz’s theory, which points out that, when searching for the right attacking plan, you should make the weakest point in the enemy position your main target.

<p class="noindent1">A special case is the so-called ‘magnet combination’. Its essence is that the enemy king is ‘drawn out’ of its stronghold by a series of sacrifices, and becomes an easy prey for the opponent’s remaining pieces. For a good magnet combination it is essential that the defender is obliged to accept the sacrifices.</p>

<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">10.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xf7+!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Here is the combination we mentioned earlier. It is based on the unprotected position of the black queen. Black must take, in view of the threat 11.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>e6.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">10…<span class="chessfont">♔</span>xf7</b></p>
<p class="noindent">10…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xf7 would not help after 11.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>e6.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">11.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>e6!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">This is the actual magnet move. If the king takes, it will be drawn further into the open with 12.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>d5+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>f5, and soon end up in a mating net: 13.g4+! <span class="chessfont">♔</span>xg4 14.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>g1+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>h5 15.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>g2 e6 16.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>g4#.</p>
<p class="noindent">These variations highlight the unfortunate position of Black’s knight on a5: it deprives its queen of an escape square. Reshevsky could have resigned after</p>

<p class="noindent">but played on in this lost position until move 42 before throwing in the towel.</p>
<p class="noindent">One of the prettiest and also most famous examples of a magnet combination can be seen in the following fragment:</p>

<p class="image"><img src="../images/00132.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="noindent">Black senses that there is something in it for him. With a fantastic queen sacrifice, he draws the white king out:</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">21…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xf2+!!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">He had to move fast, since he was already some material behind.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">22.<span class="chessfont">♔</span>xf2 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>g4+ 23.<span class="chessfont">♔</span>f3</b></p>
<p class="noindent">This is the purpose of a magnet combination: the enemy king is lured forward, after which the hungry black pieces hurl themselves at him. Clearly, the white king could not move back, because after 23.<span class="chessfont">♔</span>g1, Black gives mate by 23…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>e3#.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">23…e4+!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Clearance! Black vacates the e5-square for a knight. 23…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xh2+ also led to a win.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">24.<span class="chessfont">♔</span>xe4</b></p>
<p class="noindent">If White takes on e4 with a piece or a pawn, there is an immediate checkmate: 24.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xe4 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>de5#.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">24…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>df6+</b></p>
<p class="noindent">The merit of this move is that the d5-square is also protected at the same time. Otherwise, the king would safely escape to the queenside.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">25.<span class="chessfont">♔</span>f3 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>xh2+</b></p>

<p class="noindent">The funny thing is that the white king is mated on its initial square. Black’s minor pieces have achieved a magnificent degree of cooperation.</p>
<p class="game2t"><a id="ch5level22" class="calibre3"></a>Garry Kasparov</p>
<p class="game1"><a id="ch5level23" class="calibre3"></a>Miguel Illescas Cordoba</p>

<p class="image"><img src="../images/00133.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="noindent">A tense position, where the strange placement of White’s king stands out. It appears to be unsafe on h3, but that is not at all the case. The black pieces don’t cooperate, mainly due to White’s strong central position.</p>
<p class="noindent">Illescas wants finally to get round to connecting his rooks and decides in favour of kingside castling.:</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">1…0-0?</b></p>
<p class="noindent">You can probably guess Kasparov’s reply. He immediately jumps at the opportunity.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">2.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>f6+!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">With this move White tears the black kingside apart, obtaining a dangerous attack against the enemy king. Since Black’s pieces can hardly intervene, it is not surprising that the attack will be successful.</p>
<p class="noindent">In his comments in Yearbook 25, Kasparov indicates that the strategic 2.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>d6! might have been even better. After 2…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xd6 3.exd6, the black pieces have no elbow room, and especially the position of his queen is a huge problem. White would have been able to win ‘with his eyes closed’. Now he still has to calculate accurately.</p>

<p class="noindent">Remarkably enough, Kasparov’s follow-up is not optimal. With 4.<span class="chessfont">♔</span>xh4! White could have cleared a square for his queen on g3, with an immediate mate threat: 4…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>fb8 (the other rook move doesn’t help either: 4…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>fd8 5.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>g3+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>f8, and now White continues with the subtle 6.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>f3! <span class="chessfont">♔</span>e8 7.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>g8+ <span class="chessfont">♗</span>f8 8.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>g2 with the magnificent threat of 9.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xf7+, followed by 10.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>h5#, which cannot be parried) 5.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>g3+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>f8 6.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>d2!

Then, after 4.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>f5, he could have struck with 4…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xf3! 5.<span class="chessfont">♔</span>xf3 (or 5.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xd7 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>h4+ 6.<span class="chessfont">♔</span>f1 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>xd7, and the black attack is already decisive) 5…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>f6 6.<span class="chessfont">♔</span>e2 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>xf5 7.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>a4 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>h4, and the white king is besieged from all sides.</p>

<p class="noindent">Now White topples over. 5.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>e2 would have put up more resistance, even though also then Black would keep the initiative with 5…e5.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00138.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">5…e5!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">This is the move that is always the secret behind all Black’s operations. Both the bishop on d7 and the rook on e8 will now play an important role.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">6.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>h1</b></p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="vel371" class="calibre3"></a>The variations that arise after the critical 6.dxe5 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>xh3+ are illustrative of the black attack.

<p class="noindent">Also after the text move, it turns out that Black has prepared a nice surprise for his opponent.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">6…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>f3! 7.dxe5</b></p>
<p class="noindent">The knight could not be captured: 7.<span class="chessfont">♔</span>xf3 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>xe3+ 8.<span class="chessfont">♔</span>xe3 exd4#.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">7…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>cxe5</b></p>

<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">1…gxf5 2.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>g3!!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">The hardest move to find in this attack. With this relatively quiet retreat, White introduces a lethal discovered check into the position.</p>

<p class="noindent">Although the black king’s position looks reasonably solid, White’s surplus of pieces on this wing brings about a quick decision.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">1.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xe8!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">The defenders of the black king are eliminated.</p>

<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">3.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>g4+</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Black resigned, as both 3…<span class="chessfont">♔</span>h8 and 3…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>g7 run into 4.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xf6.</p>

<p class="noindent">The ‘hole in the king position’ has already been created. All that remains for White is to bring in his pieces.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">1.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>h6</b></p>
<p class="noindent">An obvious move which, however, turns out to contain some hidden extra points. First of all White threatens 2.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>c2, after which 3.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xh7# is unavoidable.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">1…f5?</b></p>
<p class="noindent">This allows an attractive combination. 1…e4 was the only move here, but after 2.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xf6 Black would face an uphill struggle as well.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">2.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xf7+!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">A bolt from the blue. Black now succumbs to a combination of factors. By the way, White had another win here: 2.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>g5+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>h8 3.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>f6+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>g8 4.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xd8 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>xd8 5.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xf7+.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">2…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xf7</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Other possibilities are: 2…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xf7 3.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>g5+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>h8 4.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xd8+; 2…<span class="chessfont">♔</span>xf7 3.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xh7+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>f6 4.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xc7.</p>

<p class="noindent">After 3…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xd8 White would not only win the exchange, but also the unfortunate knight on b6: 4.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>g5+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>f8 5.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xd8+.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">4.b3</b></p>
