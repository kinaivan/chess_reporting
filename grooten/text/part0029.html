<p class="level"><b class="calibre1">24.1 Tigran Petrosian</b></p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="vel249" class="calibre3"></a>At some time, one way or another, I became intrigued by the play of the ninth World Champion, Tigran Petrosian. The book <i class="calibre4">Petrosian’s Best Games of Chess</i> by Peter Clarke features proudly on my bookshelf. The English author was clearly a fan of the champion of mysterious chess.</p>
<p class="noindent">Often it’s not really clear how Petrosian won his games. At first sight not a lot is happening, and many positions appear to be completely equal. But suddenly he has obtained a clear advantage. And before his opponent knows what’s happening, he is looking at a cheerless position. How on earth did he do it? Studying the games of the ninth World Champion has clearly helped me as a player to improve my strategic insight significantly. One term springs to my mind if I am to characterize his play: ‘total control!’</p>
<p class="noindent">His positions are usually super-healthy. Hardly any weaknesses in his pawn structure. Active pieces, long-term play. All founded on formidable chess insight.</p>
<p class="noindent">For people who like sparkling attacking play, Petrosian is the wrong man. They will be inclined to label his play as ‘boring’, ‘defensive’ and ‘risk-free’. With the exception of the first of these stereotypes, I cannot blame them. Petrosian treats a chess game as a kind of ‘catenaccio’ (an Italian soccer strategy). From a closed defensive formation, the footballers try to tempt the opponent into making mistakes. And then their punishment is merciless. This playing method has brought Italy great successes in soccer. Petrosian’s play has been compared with catenaccio, but also with the hunting methods of a tiger. His first name Tigran seems to point to this as well. A tiger stalks its prey, now and then striking out with its claw to wound it. And when the prey no longer sees a chance to escape, it is devoured.</p>
<p class="level"><b class="calibre1">24.2 Exploiting small advantages</b></p>
<p class="noindent">The way in which Petrosian caused the strongest players in the world to falter is far from boring to me. Obviously this is a matter of taste, but after a closer look at the profound way in which Petrosian tackles his victims even the fiercest attacking player will feel a glimpse of admiration.</p>
<p class="noindent">Petrosian was a past master in collecting and exploiting minuscule advantages. It is not surprising that at times he managed to obtain a good knight against a bad bishop seemingly out of nothing. Or the opposite: a mighty bishop versus his opponent’s crippled knight. Many attacking players have crashed on his cunning defence. With his prophylactic way of thinking, he was, as it were, moving along with his opponent. If there was a remote danger, somewhere on the horizon, he reacted immediately. This way of playing proved to be very frustrating for many opponents. How could they ever unsaddle this superman? Any attempt was parried even before the actual skirmishes started! And if the position did become sharp, the former World Champion turned out to be an excellent calculator and an inventive defender.</p>

<p class="noindent">After a heavy strategic struggle, Kasparov has driven his opponent into a corner by active play and by sacrificing a pawn. The black king is highly exposed, and the white pieces have taken up menacing positions.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">32.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>a2!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">The exclamation mark was given by Kasparov. Perhaps there was an even stronger plan at hand. It was possible to play the knight to a3, introducing sacrificial possibilities on b5. Black can parry that threat with, for instance, (32.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>a3) 32…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>b6, but after 33.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>a2 <span class="chessfont">♔</span>b7, the black king is suddenly on the long diagonal. With 34.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>c2! <span class="chessfont">♖</span>a8 35.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>b4, White can quickly exert pressure on d5. Even if Black can avert the first threats by 35…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>d6, after 36.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>b1 followed by <span class="chessfont">♕</span>b3, he faces a renewed attack on his pinned knight on d5. Black remains under heavy pressure, and it doesn’t look as if he will be able to work his way out of it any time soon.</p>

<p class="noindent">Petrosian makes a wise decision, removing his king from the a-file in advance, as the a6-point may come under fire very soon. Obviously, taking the white knight is taboo, in view of 32…bxc4 33.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xa6+!, with mate by force.</p>
<p class="noindent">On 32…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>d6, White has a combination that yields him an advantage: 33.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xb5!? <span class="chessfont">♖</span>xb5 34.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xd6 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>xd6 35.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xb5.</p>

<p class="noindent"><a id="vel56" class="calibre3"></a>Kasparov: ‘Strangely enough, this natural move, building up the pressure, is a serious mistake. I underestimated Black’s defensive potential! (…) He should not be <i class="calibre4">circumventing, but attacking Black’s fortifications</i> – at a6, b5 and d5.’ This aim could have been achieved by the knight manoeuvre <span class="chessfont">♘</span>c4-a3-c2-b4. Kasparov discovered the grandiose move 33.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>a3! immediately after the game. ‘In my book <i class="calibre4">The Test of Time</i> (1984) I gave 33…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>b6 34.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>c2! <span class="chessfont">♖</span>a8 35.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>b4 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>d6</p>

<p class="noindent">Even so, with the help of the computer I was able to find the accurate 36.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>b1! <span class="chessfont">♘</span>b8 (36…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>c4? 37.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>a3!) 37.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>b3 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>c4 (37…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>d8 38.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>c1) 38.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>c1 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>xc1+ 39.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xc1 with an overwhelming advantage for White.</p>
<p class="noindent">My computer friend also brought some ‘joy’ in another direction. In my book I stated that after 33.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>a3! the reply 33…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>7b6 would lose to 34.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xb5 axb5 35.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xb5 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>d8 (35…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>a8?? 36.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xd5+ and mate) 36.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>b4! <span class="chessfont">♕</span>e8 (37…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>f7 37.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>c5) 37.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>a6+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>c6 38.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>c5 <span class="chessfont">♔</span>d7 (38…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>a8 39.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xb6+) 39.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>f1!+–. However, it transpired that 35…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>h8! is stronger – here White has to display exceptional ingenuity in his attack:</p>
<p class="noindent">1) 36.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xd5+ (36.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>c3?! <span class="chessfont">♔</span>c8!) 36…exd5 37.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>c3 <span class="chessfont">♔</span>c8 38.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>a7 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>c4 39.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xd5 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>xd2 40.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>cxc7+ <span class="chessfont">♕</span>xc7 41.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xc7+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>xc7 42.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>a5+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>d6 43.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xd2 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>xh3 44.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>c1 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>bh8 45.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>c5+ and only a special analysis can establish whether the queen and pawn will overcome the resistance of the two rooks;</p>
<p class="noindent">2) 36.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>b4! <span class="chessfont">♕</span>e8 37.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>a6+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>c6 38.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>f1!

<p class="noindent">Thus, to find the narrow path leading to a win for White, many years and lots of megahertz of computer power were required. But at the board, not suspecting any latent dangers, I continued simply building up the pressure. Such a general approach does not always prove correct, as I came to realise within literally a couple of moves.’</p>
<p class="noindent">‘33.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>b1!? was interesting, but this too would not have solved the problems facing White is facing’, wrote Kasparov. Today, in 2016, the strongest engines consider this possibility to be the strongest. There is no sensible idea to be found against the sacrifice on b5 and the <span class="chessfont">♘</span>a5 motifs. Three examples:</p>
<p class="indentv">A) On 33…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>a8, there follows 34.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xd5+ exd5 35.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xb5+! axb5 36.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xb5+ <span class="chessfont">♘</span>b6 37.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xb6 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>xb6 38.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xd5+, and White regains the sacrificed material with interest;</p>
<p class="indentv">B) 33…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>h8 is a way to create an escape route for the black king, but it is of no use. White continues strongly with 34.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>c2, discouraging the black king’s escape via c8: 34…<span class="chessfont">♔</span>c8 (other moves, like 34…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>f8, also fail to the motif of the knight’s entrance via a5. Here, 35.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>a5! is very strong: 35…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xa5 36.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xa5+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>a8 37.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>c6 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>b6 38.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xe6!, and now the <span class="chessfont">♗</span>g2 will also have its say!) 35.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>a5, and the knight will decisively penetrate via c6, as becomes clear after 35…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>a8 36.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xd5 exd5 37.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>bc3 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>a7 38.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>c6, winning;</p>

<p class="noindent">White again plays on general grounds, hoping that an opportunity for him to land some combinative blow will present itself. After the ‘concrete’ 35.e4 fxe4 36.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xe4 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>f7, Black could have felt quite calm with his powerful knight at d5.

<p class="noindent">In post-game analyses it was noticeable how much more deeply my opponent had evaluated the resulting positions’ – wrote Kasparov.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><a id="vel252" class="calibre3"></a>But did Petrosian only defend? Certainly not! In many games he took the initiative from the first move, and – starting from a healthy set-up – searched for ways to unsaddle his opponent. Petrosian once wrote that it was not important which of the pieces had been removed from the board. What mattered was what was left!</p>
<p class="noindent">With his deep insight he converted many games to a win in this way – his opponent would be left behind in despair, wondering how he could ever have been saddled with such bad pieces so suddenly…</p>
<p class="noindent">Petrosian was also a great endgame virtuoso. With a steady hand he steered many a small advantage, obtained in the middlegame, into the endgame, where it was often easier to convert it to a win. Apart from that, he also had the ‘patience of a saint’. Not infrequently he got a large space advantage in quite closed positions. Then he would start working, taking his time to put his opponent on the rack for hours on end. He would take great care to prepare the occupation of an open file or a pawn break. Only when all the pieces were on the right squares he would come up with a pawn move that his opponent had seen coming for hours, without being able to do anything about it. Also, some of his manoeuvres were ‘feigned’. At a certain point his opponents could no longer discern whether Petrosian was working constructively on a winning plan, or just trying to throw dust in their eyes.</p>
<p class="level"><b class="calibre1">24.3 Combating the King’s Indian</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Petrosian was a past master in the struggle against a sharp opening system, the King’s Indian, an important way of combating the opening move 1.d4.</p>
<p class="noindent">As we all know, in the King’s Indian Black relies heavily on the pawn push …f7-f5. After Petrosian had invented the system with 7.d5 that now carries his name, he attained many successes with it.</p>

<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">8.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>g5 h6 9.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>h4 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>a6 10.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>d2 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>e8</b></p>
<p class="noindent">The black queen moves out of the pin by the <span class="chessfont">♗</span>h4, thus enabling the <span class="chessfont">♘</span>f6 to make a move, and introducing the possibility of …f7-f5 – as said, this is the standard plan in this variation. Here, it’s essential that Black leaves his pawn on g6! For if White answers …f7-f5 with e4xf5, Black will be able to recapture by …g6xf5. With two pawns on e5 and f5, Black will get a flexible pawn front, preventing White’s pieces from occupying central squares.</p>
<p class="noindent">This is the reason why Petrosian would like to provoke the pawn move …g6-g5. If the black pawn is on g5, and Black later plays …f7-f5, White replies e4xf5. As a result, he will gain control of the e4-square for one of his pieces – in most cases, a knight. Petrosian often proved he was a past master in gaining a positional advantage by using the control of this strong square.</p>

<p class="noindent">Suddenly threatening to trap the <span class="chessfont">♗</span>h4 by …g6-g5 and …h5-h4. 13…f5 was also possible. Black even threatens to trap the <span class="chessfont">♗</span>h4. But in practice, it turns out that White has a reasonable counter with 14.f3. Nevertheless, White’s chances of achieving an advantage are very slight.</p>
<p class="noindent">Black can first work on the activation of his dark-squared bishop with 14… <span class="chessfont">♗</span>h6.</p>

<p class="noindent">This was the move Petrosian would be waiting for. This pawn move weakens the light squares in Black’s position. The consequences of this were made clear in a game Petrosian-Yukhtman, Tbilisi 1959. We now present this game with a meticulous verbal analysis.</p>

<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">10.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>g3 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>h5</b></p>
<p class="noindent">At the time, it was thought that Black was fine here. The bishop on g3 is out of play, the black knight can go to the beautiful square f4, and the liberating action …f7-f5 has become possible.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">11.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>d2 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>f4 12.0-0</b></p>
<p class="noindent">It seems as if Black has achieved what he wanted. In reality, there is only one good move in this position.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">12…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>c5?!</b></p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00739.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="noindent">As will become clear in the further course of the game, this is a considerable strategic mistake, although it is hard to recognize it at this stage. By the way, today’s engines also have great difficulty in finding the right moves here. Without a doubt, the black player should have taken the light-squared bishop while this was still possible: 12…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xe2+. But of course, it didn’t enter his head to exchange his ‘beautiful’ knight for White’s bad bishop. In the game, we will see the consequences of this omission.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">13.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>g4!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">White would surely like to exchange his bad bishop for Black’s good one.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">13…a5?!</b></p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="vel254" class="calibre3"></a>This looks logical, but in view of Petrosian’s measured reply, he should have preferred something else.</p>
<p class="noindent">With 13…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xg4, he could also have exchanged the light-squared bishops, but the difference is that after 14.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xg4 h5 15.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>f5 h4, White has to give up his bishop for the knight on f4 – which was actually one of the ideas behind Black’s play. After having been buried alive, the <span class="chessfont">♗</span>g7 now comes to life after 16.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xf4 exf4, and it looks as if this is still more or less playable for Black, even though he has had to give up a number of light squares on the king’s wing.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">14.f3!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">A very clever move. White prefers the exchange to take place on g4, as after …<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xg4 fxg4, the f5-square will be firmly fixed, making …f7-f5 impossible for good. The second idea behind the text move is that White can manoeuvre his bishop from g3 to f2 and e3, where it is much better placed.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">14…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>cd3</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Hitting thin air. Relatively better was 14…h5 15.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xc8 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>xc8, although also here, after 16.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>f2 White would obtain excellent prospects.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">15.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>c2 c6</b></p>
<p class="noindent">If Black thinks he can generate counterplay with this move, he is in for a bad disappointment. In fact he is just helping White by opening lines and diagonals on the queenside. One thing White has to beware of is the check on b6.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">16.<span class="chessfont">♔</span>h1 h5 17.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xc8 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>xc8</b></p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00740.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="noindent">On the surface, things do not look so bad for Black. The rook is on the same file as White’s queen, and he can open this file at any moment by …c6xd5.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">18.a3</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Another one of those ‘little’ moves that were Petrosian’s trademark. He has seen that Black has no concrete threats, and in the meantime prevents …<span class="chessfont">♘</span>d3-b4.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">18…cxd5 19.cxd5?!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Oddly enough, this exchange plays into White’s hands.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00741.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="noindent">Black has made his own d6-pawn weak, which means that he has voluntarily carried out White’s plan for him!</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">19…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>c5?!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Giving up part of his activity. Much better was 19…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>b6, so as after 20.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>ab1?!, to continue with the quite annoying ‘disturbing move’ 20…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>e3!. Then, White’s best reply is 20.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xf4!, since now Black cannot take back with the pawn: 20…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xf4 21.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>ae1, after which he can drive off the knight by g2-g3. White can counter the temporary activity by 21…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>d4 with 22.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>b3 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>d3 23.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>f2, after which he can further increase his small strategic advantages.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">20.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>f2 g4?</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Black changes tack. Suddenly he considers that he should be playing on the kingside after all. But this pawn move again weakens several squares, and provides White with several targets. Black is in fact digging his own grave.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">21.g3 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>g6 22.fxg4 hxg4</b></p>

<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">23.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>e3!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Again, very strong. Not only does White prevent …<span class="chessfont">♗</span>g7-h6 (meaning that this bishop remains very bad), but at the same time, he conquers the f5-square for his pieces.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">23…b5?!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">A pawn sacrifice that brings Black nothing.</p>

<p class="noindent"><a id="vel255" class="calibre3"></a>Black is lost, and it’s all or nothing for him now. Of course, Petrosian sees to it that it will be the latter…</p>

<p class="noindent">And here the black player had had enough.</p>
<p class="level"><b class="calibre1">24.4 The ‘V for Victory’</b></p>
<p class="noindent">All this reminds me of a small anecdote told by Clarke in the book I mentioned above. As we have seen, Petrosian enjoyed restraining his opponent’s play. Especially against King’s Indian set-ups he was phenomenal. All players who opt for this opening with black dream of a ferocious attack against the white king. Not with Petrosian!</p>
<p class="noindent1">In the following game we see how the white player manages to lock the king’s wing by provoking the moves …h7-h6 and …g6-g5. After that, he fixes the f5-square by g2-g4, to prevent Black from ever achieving the …f7-f5 push. Petrosian put his pawns on d5, e4, f3, g4 and h5 (versus d6, e5, f7, g5 and h6), and Peter Clarke jokingly called this formation the ‘V for Victory’!</p>
<p class="block">V for Victory</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00743.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="vel256" class="calibre3"></a>Next, Petrosian manages to provoke new weaknesses on the queenside, and generates active play there. After that, the opponent often collapses.</p>

<p class="noindent"><a id="vel318" class="calibre3"></a>One of the greatest aficionados of the King’s Indian, Teimour Radjabov, opts for a transfer to the Benoni by 6…c5 in this position.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">7.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>e3 e5</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Here, Black can still aim for Benoni-type positions with 7…c5.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">8.d5 c6?!</b></p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="ch24inlevel6" class="calibre3"></a>This is obviously not the way to play. But Petrosian’s approach to this position has become a wise lesson for anyone who plays the King’s Indian. In a game Vitugov-Inarkiev, Moscow ch-RUS 2007, Black opted for a ‘Benoni Wall’ here by 8…c5, which brought him success.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00744.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">9.h4!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">An attacking move? We will see soon.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">9…cxd5 10.cxd5</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Wasn’t it White’s plan to play c4-c5 and then c5xd6 at some point? Well, Black has done this for him now.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">10…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>bd7 11.h5</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Threatening to open the h-file.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">11…g5</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Also here, White has managed to provoke Black into playing …g6-g5. And that was just what the Armenian wanted.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">12.f3 a6</b></p>
<p class="noindent">The black player hasn’t treated the King’s Indian as it should be treated. His sixth move deserves disapproval, since on move 11 he was forced to play the weakening …g6-g5. From here on, we will present the game in quiz form.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="noindent"><b class="calibre1">QUESTION 1:</b> How does White exploit the advantages in his position?</p>
</div>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">13.g4!</b></p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00745.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="noindent">Excellently played! Black’s thematic push in the King’s Indian (…f7-f5) is now permanently impossible, and since the f5-square has been fixed, White will be able to post a knight there later on.</p>
<p class="noindent">With the white pawns constituting such a nice formation, Clarke enthusiastically called this the ‘V for Victory’ formation. Black does not avail himself of the standard plan, and thanks to his space advantage in the centre, White can prepare to create play on the queenside. One of the ideas is to increase his space advantage, for example, by the push a2-a4-a5, fixing the b6-square. After this, his pieces can be regrouped to try to enter the seventh rank, or to take aim at the weakling on b7.</p>
<p class="noindent">Less good was 13.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>h3 – because there is a more principled option, but also because the knight cannot quickly move to good squares from h3.</p>
<p class="noindent">It seems like a good idea to post the bishop on c2 with 13.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>d3, but this is not really to the point.</p>
<p class="noindent">The sacrifice 13.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xg5? is nonsense. After 13…hxg5 14.h6 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>h8 15.h7+ <span class="chessfont">♘</span>xh7, there is no compensation for the sacrificed material in sight.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">13…b5</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Since he is already seeing dark clouds gathering over his position if White manages to play a2-a4, the black player wants to act first. But with the text, he compromises his play on the wing where White is the most active. What follows now is another display of excellent insight in the game.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="noindent"><b class="calibre1">QUESTION 2:</b> How does White handle this position?</p>
</div>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">14.a4!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">A fine move, conquering the c4-square. Also very interesting, and perhaps equally strong, was 14.b4, to follow up with a2-a4 later. Also here, Black is saddled with several weaknesses.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">14…b4</b></p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="noindent"><b class="calibre1">QUESTION 3:</b> Where to move the knight, and why?</p>
</div>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">15.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>b1!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">The point of the previous move. The white knight strives for the c4-square, from where it can take aim at the weak pawn on d6, which forms the base of Black’s pawn chain.</p>
<p class="noindent">Another idea is 15.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>a2, so as to continue with <span class="chessfont">♘</span>a2-c1-b3. From this square, a black knight appearing on c5 can be driven off. Still, the text move is to be preferred.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">15…a5 16.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>d2 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>c5</b></p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00746.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="noindent">Now that Black has no counterchances on the kingside, White can focus on the queenside.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="noindent"><b class="calibre1">QUESTION 4:</b> How does he go about this?</p>
</div>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">17.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xc5!!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Very good. You are not allowing yourself to be hindered by dogmas. True, White surrenders his beautiful bishop, but in return, he saddles Black with a weak pawn on an open file. At the same time, he creates a protected passed pawn for himself.</p>
<p class="noindent">The normal move is 17.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>c4, which can be regarded as the logical follow-up to the previous moves. However, White does not accomplish much with this move at this stage. The knight on c5 is standing there like a tower of strength, hindering White’s efforts to make progress: 17…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>e7 18.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>c1 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>fd7, and for the time being, Black holds.</p>
<p class="noindent">17.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>b3 is not logical, as the knight was aiming to go to c4. And there is another reason why this continuation is not so convincing. Black can muddy the waters by 17…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>cxe4!? 18.fxe4 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>xe4, followed by …f7-f5.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">17…dxc5</b></p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="noindent"><b class="calibre1">QUESTION 5:</b> What is the consistent follow-up here?</p>
</div>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">18.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>b5!!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Perfect! The black knight is preparing to block the protected passed pawn, and so it has to be eliminated before anything else. White also gives up his second bishop, but this is favourable for him, as the white knights are very strong.</p>
<p class="noindent">18.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>c4 looks like the logical continuation, but with 18…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>a6 and …<span class="chessfont">♘</span>e8 followed by …<span class="chessfont">♘</span>d6, Black can attack this strong knight, and occupy the ‘stopping square’ d6.</p>
<p class="noindent">18.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>c1 is a move that does no harm, but it can also be played at a later stage since White has a better continuation. There might follow 18…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>d7 (18…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>b6; 18…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>e7 19.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>c2 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>d7 20.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>b5) 19.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>b3 (19.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>b5 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>b6 20.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>c4) 19…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>b6 20.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>c2 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>a6.</p>

<p class="noindent"><b class="calibre1">QUESTION 7:</b> White has firm control of the position. His knights are controlling important squares. But how can he make progress?</p>
</div>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">27.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>f2!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">You have spotted well that White has to find play on the c-file. The weak pawn on c5 is put under pressure. Also strong here is 27.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>fd1, although it seems as if there is not much to do for the rook here. For the moment, Black can keep control of the d6-square. However White has two plans:</p>
<ul class="calibre8">
<li class="calibre7">he can work with d5-d6, then perhaps trade the d6-pawn for the c5-pawn, and break through in the centre;</li>
<li class="calibre7">he can regroup his pieces, manoeuvring his knight from c4 to d3 after doubling on the c-file, to put pressure on the c5-pawn.</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">Slightly premature is 27.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>f5, as it is better for White to keep this possibility at hand than play it.</p>
<p class="noindent">Another idea would be 27.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>e3, to establish a knight on f5. This is certainly not a bad idea. But it will still be difficult for White to find a way to make real progress.</p>
<p class="noindent">Here, 27.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>c2 amounts to the same thing. White wants to create the option of doubling on the c-file.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">27…<span class="chessfont">♔</span>h7 28.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>fc2 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>a6</b></p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00749.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="noindent">Black is giving in. He puts the pawn on e5 on offer, hoping to find more employment for his bishops. With passive defence, after a move like 28…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>d7, White would have to make some more effort to make progress. He would eventually conquer the pawn on c5, and win anyway.</p>
<div class="sidebar">

<p class="noindent1">I put this ‘V for Victory’ on the board several times. Players I had trained with would know that I aimed for it, and would burst into laughter when they passed my board and saw the ‘V’. My unsuspecting opponent would look up in annoyance – what was wrong with these onlookers? One example is a game from the first round of an open tournament, against the highly sympathetic Marcel Laarhoven, from a town near Eindhoven. Marcel was an enthusiastic chess organizer, and the father of the talented Thijs Laarhoven. He passed away unexpectedly in 2016.</p>

<p class="noindent">Black does not yet decide whether to make it a Stonewall, or to proceed to a type of position with …d7-d6, as in the Classical Dutch. The immediate 6…d5 is also possible: 7.b3 c6 8.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>a3, exchanging his bad bishop for Black’s good one.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00755.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">7.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>c2</b></p>
<p class="noindent">White is making preparations for the pawn push e2-e4, forcing Black to lay his cards on the table. The direct 7.b3 is possible, once again getting ready to make the favourable trade. But Black can still postpone …d7-d5 by 7…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>e8, as now 8.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>a3 doesn’t make much sense due to 8…d6.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">7…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>e8 8.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>bd2</b></p>
<p class="noindent">It is always hard for White to determine where to put his knights. In the Stonewall, he usually strives for a set-up like the one Petrosian will soon get on the board.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">8…d5 9.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>e5 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>bd7 10.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>d3 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>e4 11.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>f3</b></p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00756.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="noindent">This is an important tabiya for the Stonewall set-up in the Dutch Defence. White would like to obtain full hegemony in the centre by <span class="chessfont">♘</span>fe5 followed by f2-f3. He can also first play b2-b3 and <span class="chessfont">♗</span>c1-b2. Once the black knight has been chased away from e4, White will eventually start exerting maximum pressure on the black pawn formation by e2-e4. We have even seen games where White also played h2-h3 and g3-g4 later.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">11…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>d6?</b></p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="ch24inlevel1" class="calibre3"></a>A strange retreat. But Bondarevsky wants to combat a white knight on e5 with both of his own knights. A better choice for Black was 11…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>h5 or 11…g5, moves that are a little more common in modern chess.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">12.b3 b5</b></p>
<p class="noindent">This was his second intention. He wants to force White to do something with his c4-pawn. This is not such a strange thought, since if White pushes this pawn, as in the game, it will hardly be possible for him to put pressure on the strongpoint d5.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">13.c5</b></p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="vel261" class="calibre3"></a>Petrosian liked to have a space advantage, so he probably didn’t hesitate long here. Bondarevsky would have got his way if White had played 13.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>fe5. After 13…bxc4 14.bxc4 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>xe5 15.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xe5 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>a6, White would have had to release the tension anyway, after which Black obtains equality.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, a fully-fledged tactician might have spotted a devious motif here, which yields White either a pawn or a large positional advantage.</p>
<p class="noindent">By 13.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>f4!? <span class="chessfont">♖</span>f6 (bad is 13…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>f7, in view of 14.cxb5 cxb5 15.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>a3 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>e4 16.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xe7 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>xe7 17.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>c6, winning a beautiful pawn) 14.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>g5 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>f8 15.c5 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>f7 16.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>d3 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>xg5 17.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xg5 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>f7 18.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xe7 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>xe7, White obtains a very comfortable position.</p>

<p class="noindent">A strong move, achieving an important goal on the queenside.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">14…bxa4</b></p>
<p class="noindent">After 14…a6? 15.axb5 cxb5, Black would have even more positional problems. White has a protected passed pawn, while Black is saddled with a weakness on a6.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">15.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xa4 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>f6 16.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>b2 a6</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Bondarevsky keeps playing passively – to the profit of students, for now we will see a wonderful display of strategic understanding! If Black wanted to free himself, he should have played 16…e5 now. However, after 17.dxe5 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>fxe5 (17…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>dxe5 18.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>fa1) 18.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>fa1 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>xd3 19.exd3 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>xb2 20.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xb2 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>xc5 21.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xa7, White has a large advantage. His pieces are much more active than Black’s.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00758.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">17.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>fe5!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">An instructive continuation, whose main point will only become clear after some time. The first intention is clear: White wants to rule out the pawn march …e6-e5 (which Black is aiming for) once and for all. White could have put immediate pressure on the queenside by 17.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>b4 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>b7 18.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>fa1, but after 18…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>c8, the worst part of the storm has subsided for Black. Of course, White can continue with 19.e3, to introduce the possibility of <span class="chessfont">♗</span>g2-f1. This is not immediately decisive, but it is certainly no picnic for Black: 19…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>d8 20.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>f1 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>b8 (20…a5 21.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>d3, followed by <span class="chessfont">♗</span>b2-c3 will probably yield White a pawn in the end), and by this brave effort Black holds…</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">17…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>fxe5</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Black cannot allow the active white knight to stay on this square. After all, didn’t he play his own knight to f7 to swipe that knight off the board as soon as it moved to e5?</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">18.dxe5</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Here, an important basic rule applies for the player who has more space: he has to keep as many pieces on the board as possible.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">18…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>e7 19.f4</b></p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00759.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="noindent">The contours of White’s ‘master plan’ start to become visible. He has achieved a gigantic advantage in space, and is able to develop play on the queenside as well as on the kingside. Since Black is saddled with a weak pawn on a6, he will aim to play on the kingside.</p>
<p class="noindent">By recapturing d4xe5, White has obtained a beautiful square for his pieces on d4. He can use it for various pieces – especially the knight.</p>
<p class="noindent">Before that, White obviously has to keep guarding his own pawn on c5, and he also has to keep a watchful eye on Black’s undertakings on the king’s wing.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">19…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>b8</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Moving out of the pin, but thereby effectively weakening the a6-pawn even more.</p>
<p class="noindent">The pawn push 19…g5 is just a blow in the air. After 20.fxg5 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>xg5 21.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>c1!, White keeps his spatial advantage, and his pieces will be even better placed, because Black has compromised his position. Please note that White’s scattered pawns (e5 and e2) are not at all weak – the e5-pawn is even highly important!</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">20.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>fa1 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>b5 21.b4</b></p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00760.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="vel262" class="calibre3"></a>This was what Black was aiming for. He has managed to provoke the move b3-b4, depriving White of the b4-square for his pieces. On the other hand, the c5-pawn has now received extra support, and the rook on b5 has become vulnerable. The first step White has to take now is to play the knight to d4. Petrosian is already planning <span class="chessfont">♗</span>g2-f1 and e2-e3, to besiege the pawn on a6.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">21…h5</b></p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="ch24inlevel2" class="calibre3"></a>Bondarevsky seeks refuge on the kingside. Again, 21…g5 would favour White after 22.fxg5 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>xg5 23.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>c1!.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">22.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>c3!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Often, it’s such ‘little moves’ that eventually carry the day in Petrosian’s games. He considers that the b4-pawn deserves extra support, but the bishop can also assist on the kingside later on via the e1-square!</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">22…h4 23.e3</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Considering the success of his 25th move, one might wonder if the former World Champion could have played it already at this point.</p>
<p class="noindent">The idea is so brilliant that we won’t reveal it yet…</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">23…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>b8?</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Much too passive. Here, or a little later, Black could have swapped pawns with 23…hxg3, to follow up with … g7-g5 or … <span class="chessfont">♕</span>e8-h5, although this would not have worried White much.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">24.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>e1!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Highly systematic: the knight aims for the d4-square, and via this square is the best way to get there.</p>
<p class="noindent">The knight retreat also introduces the threat of <span class="chessfont">♗</span>g2-f1.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">24…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>b7</b></p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00761.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">25.gxh4!!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Petrosian does not give his opponent a second chance. This is one of those brilliant strategic concepts that Petrosian was famous for. Further on, we will explain in more detail why this exchange on h4 is the appropriate plan for White.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">25…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xh4 26.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>f3 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>d8 27.h4!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">With this move, White fixes the g5-square, and it enables Petrosian to obtain an important positional advantage on the kingside as well.</p>
<p class="noindent">So this was the point of the exchange on h4. Fixing the weakness of the g5-square also means nipping all of the opponent’s attacking chances in the bud. Moreover, he has opened the g-file for his own major pieces. Since Black also has his weakness on a6, and since, due to his shortage in space, he cannot place his pieces effectively, his position now quickly goes downhill.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">27…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>h5 28.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>e1</b></p>
<p class="noindent">This bishop was poised to protect Black’s potential target, the pawn on h4. Since Black does not have the right pieces to pound on this weakness, he isn’t getting any counterplay.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">28…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>d7 29.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>f2</b></p>
<p class="noindent">The queen also lends a helping hand on the kingside.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00762.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">29…<span class="chessfont">♔</span>f7?</b></p>
<p class="noindent">This error drastically shortens the game. Black had great problems already, but with 29…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>c8, he could still have put up a tenacious defence. White’s plan in that case is to involve his rooks in the play via the g-file, and eventually use the g6-square for his knight.</p>
<p class="noindent">The game might have continued as follows: 30.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>f1 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>c7 31.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>g3 <span class="chessfont">♔</span>f7 32.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>e2 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>h6 33.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>4a2 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>h8 34.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>d3 <span class="chessfont">♔</span>f8 35.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>g2 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>h5 36.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>e2 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>h6 37.h5! <span class="chessfont">♖</span>g8 38.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>h4 <span class="chessfont">♔</span>e8 39.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>g6 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>h7 40.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>h3 <span class="chessfont">♔</span>f7 41.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>h4.</p>

<p class="noindent">Slowly but surely, the right pieces get traded off, after which White’s pieces will penetrate further into the black position.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">30.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>f1</b></p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="vel263" class="calibre3"></a>Petrosian consistently continues his plan: pressurizing the a6-pawn, and at the same time preparing a regrouping on the king’s wing, which will eventually enable him to make progress along the g-file.</p>
<p class="noindent">White could have changed plans with 30.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>g5+, since the surrender of the dark-squared bishop by 30…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xg5 is also a tremendous concession for Black.

<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">36.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>g3</b></p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="vel264" class="calibre3"></a>Petrosian keeps following his original plan. At this moment, 36.b5! also came strongly into consideration for White, especially since 36…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xc5?! does not work, due to 37.bxc6 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>xd4 38.cxb7 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>xa1 39.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>a2 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>c6 40.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>a7!, with a decisive advantage. But such concrete variations were not up the ninth World Champion’s street – certainly not right before the time control, as then accidents can easily happen. In modern chess, we more often see top players suddenly ending their manoeuvres when they spot a tactical possibility that yields them a decisive advantage. Calculating skills have improved in the course of the years, even though the human player still does not have the slightest chance against a computer in this field!</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">36…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>b8?</b></p>
<p class="noindent">This worsens Black’s case. A wait-and-see attitude with 36…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>c7 was preferable. White still has to prove that he can break down this wall. He can work with the breakthrough b4-b5, but he has to prepare it very carefully.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">37.h5!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">White takes immediate profit. Now that the h4-pawn is no longer a weakness (typically, it is hardly weak on h5), Black is ensnared further.</p>

<p class="level"><b class="calibre1">24.5 Prophylaxis</b></p>
<p class="noindent">The concept of prophylaxis is defined as ‘measures designed to preserve health and prevent disease’. If we translate this into chess terminology, prophylaxis means taking measures against potential threats, and hindering dangerous possibilities for the opponent.</p>
<p class="noindent">I think that there is a category of players who consider prophylactic thinking and the feeling of control of paramount importance in any position. If that is true, is this based on a deeply-rooted feeling of fear? Does this type of player simply hate to lose? Or should we formulate the question differently? Perhaps players with this style are bent on letting their opponents know who’s the boss? Doesn’t the type of play they aim for give the opponent a constant feeling of being overtaken by events? And doesn’t this dominant approach have the effect that the opponent is subjected to so much pressure that his spirit breaks and he starts making mistakes? I presume it’s a little bit of everything.</p>
<p class="noindent1">For instance, it once struck me that the Swede Ulf Andersson hated losing so much that he even allowed draws to players with a much lower Elo rating to their name. With black, equalizing after the opening, he would often be satisfied with a half point at a very early stage. I find this surprising, but I have to add that I am a great admirer of Andersson’s play. The way he would stay afloat with black in sharp Sicilians, especially in his heyday, often against opponents who were known for their formidable attacking abilities, filled me with great respect for him. So of course we cannot omit to show you an impressive piece of prophylactic thinking by the Swede at this point.</p>

<p class="noindent"><a id="s3" class="calibre3"></a>Although White has traded his dark-squared bishop for a knight in the opening, he seems to be better off at first sight. He has a considerable edge in space, and is threatening to create a passed a-pawn by b4-b5, which could mean trouble for Black. With his next move, Andersson thwarts this plan in a highly imaginative way.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">15…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>a7!!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Who would even consider such a move? Black prepares to double his rooks on a closed file! – only to make the b4-b5 push unattractive. This is one of many unfathomable moves the Swede has played in his career – the type of moves that enrich the game of chess. Andersson must have considered the rigorous 15…c6 too, but probably didn’t like it. It doesn’t make the bishop on b7 look any prettier, and if White manages to push e4-e5, Black will suffer from holes on the dark squares.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">16.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>e3</b></p>
<p class="noindent">On 16.b5, he had planned 16…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>fa8!, and now White has to make a big effort to avoid getting into trouble strategically. After 17.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>b3 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>d8, Black is for choice, since the a5-pawn is more of a weakness than a trump card.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">16…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>e7?!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Perhaps a small stain on this game. Probably, he should have reversed the moves with 16…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>fa8 to prove his point.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">17.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>a2</b></p>
<p class="noindent">White could have played 17.d5!?, after which 17…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>aa8 is more or less forced, which means that Black wouldn’t realize his idea. In that case, White could have achieved some advantage by 18.dxe6 fxe6 19.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>d4, since Black has been forced to give up his beautiful bishop.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">17…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>fa8!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">It’s getting stranger and stranger. Black has doubled his rooks on a closed file! The intention of the text move is to frustrate the b4-b5 push, so that Black can try to get full control of the b5-square by …<span class="chessfont">♗</span>b7-c6.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">18.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>b3</b></p>
<p class="noindent">After 18.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>c1 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>f6 19.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>b3, 19…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>c8, intending …<span class="chessfont">♗</span>c8-d7, is quite reasonable.</p>

<p class="noindent">This move fits into Black’s concept. He takes further control of the b5-square, and thus hopes to prevent b4-b5 once and for all. If he succeeds in this, the b4-pawn will become a weakness.</p>

<p class="noindent"><a id="vel503" class="calibre3"></a>Timman once wrote that there is not a player in the world who knows better which piece to retreat, and to which square, than Ulf Andersson.

That means that he will also have to master the type of play we have just discussed, if he wants to establish himself as one of the greatest players on this earth. I realized this when I witnessed the young Garry Kasparov in the flesh. I saw him for the first time at the World U20 Championship in Dortmund. I went there with two friends to cheer my club mate, the then Dutch junior champion, Frans Cuijpers. Cuijpers was trampled underfoot by a series of tactical shots that Kasparov conjured up during the game.

<p class="noindent">20…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xf5 wasn’t more tenacious, since after 21.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xf5, follows 21…gxf5 22.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>h5 and now:</p>

<p class="noindent">And the eternal pin leads to Black’s downfall. Therefore, he resigned.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Even though this was a tactical struggle, there is no denying that Kasparov dictated the play from the beginning to the end. So this way of playing is also a means to exert control in a game.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="vel358" class="calibre3"></a>One year later (Graz 1981) I was playing at the same tables during a match between the Soviet Union and the Netherlands for the U27 World Team Championship. Also in this tournament, the way Kasparov crashed through his opponents’ positions left a great impression on me. However, one aspect was striking: based on his excellent opening preparation Kasparov would as it were push his opponents into positions where he could attack the enemy king to his heart’s content. And then he would do a fantastic job. If possible, the analyses after the games were even more impressive here. He would shower down an enormous amount of variations over the heads of his already crushed opponents…</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="ch24inlevel5" class="calibre3"></a>Despite these exceptional achievements, I wondered how this super-talent would manifest himself in a company of players who would not be led to the slaughter so easily. Would he bear up against pure world-class players, who were themselves used to dictating the game from move one? The overwhelming answer by this new promise for the future already announced itself one year later. With great supremacy, Kasparov became the victor in the extremely tough Bugojno 1982 tournament. And the way he did it! Unbeaten, with 9½ points out of 13 games, he ended 1½ point ahead of his next pursuers, Lev Polugaevsky and Ljubomir Ljubojevic. But who else had been playing? Almost the entire world elite of the day: the two former World Champions Boris Spassky and Tigran Petrosian, the solid German top player Robert Hübner and the Swede Ulf Andersson, not to mention the Great Dane Bent Larsen, our compatriot Jan Timman and the ‘oldies’ Lubosh Kavalek, Miguel Najdorf, Svetozar Gligoric and Borislav Ivkov.</p>
<p class="noindent">When I played through the following game, I almost fell from my chair…</p>

<p class="image"><img src="../images/00775.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">7…d5</b></p>
<p class="noindent">We are entering Catalan waters, with the difference that the dark-squared bishops have already been exchanged. 7…d6 is played more often. This continuation would have been more up Petrosian’s street. Black puts his centre pawns on dark squares, and later he will play …e6-e5 or …c7-c5, and thus improve his bishop.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">8.0-0 dxc4</b></p>
<p class="noindent">This is Black’s idea. He wants to trade all the pawns in the centre, hoping in this way to neutralize White’s opening advantage.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">9.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>a3 c5 10.dxc5 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>xc5 11.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>ac1 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>c6 12.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xc4</b></p>
<p class="noindent">White has his pawns back, and Black is still a long way away from equality. The most important thing is that White has already nicely developed his bishop to g2, whereas Black’s bishop on c8 does not have a bright future at this point.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">12…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>e7</b></p>
<p class="noindent">This is forced, since White was ready to play <span class="chessfont">♘</span>ce5, followed by <span class="chessfont">♘</span>xc6, damaging Black’s pawn structure.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">13.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>fe5</b></p>
<p class="noindent">A strong move that serves two purposes:</p>
<p class="noindent">1) The diagonal of White’s strong bishop is opened;</p>
<p class="noindent">2) The liberating action …e6-e5 is prevented for the time being.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">13…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xe5 14.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xe5</b></p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00776.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="noindent">A good moment to take a closer look at the position. The pawn structure is entirely symmetrical. Both sides still have all their major pieces, and the same types of minor pieces. There are three factors that determine the considerable trouble Black finds himself in:</p>
<ul class="calibre8">
<li class="calibre7">White’s bishop is terribly strong, which means that Black cannot develop his c8-bishop for the time being. As a consequence, he cannot connect his rooks either.</li>
<li class="calibre7">The knight on e5 has a paralysing effect on the black position.</li>
<li class="calibre7">The white rook on c1 is very favourably placed on the open c-file, preventing Black from comfortably extricating himself.</li>
</ul>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">14…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>d5</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Black tries to curb the power of White’s bishop. By the way, this isn’t a pawn sacrifice.</p>
<p class="noindent">14…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>d8 brings no relief, as White keeps pressure after 15.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>a5 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>d5.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">15.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>fd1</b></p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="vel63" class="calibre3"></a>Kasparov brings his last piece into play. Just look at how all the white pieces are posted, and how cramped Black’s position is… Obviously, giving up the beautiful bishop for the knight was hardly an option. After 15.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xd5?! <span class="chessfont">♖</span>d8, Black will simply get his piece back, and he has got rid of an important part of his disadvantage.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">15…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>b6</b></p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00777.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="noindent">This is not a solution to the problem of Black’s position, but what was the alternative? One might wonder whether 15…f6 wouldn’t have been a better idea, to at least get rid of the annoying knight on e5. After 16.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>c4 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>b8, White has several ways to retain his advantage. For instance, one idea is 17.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>d4 b6 18.e4 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>c7 19.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>d6, and Black still has significant problems.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">16.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>a5!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Kasparov was very content with this move. As becomes clear from the variations given above, by…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>a8-b8, Black tries to relieve his bishop on c8 from the unpleasant task of keeping the b7-pawn protected. On this square, the white queen contributes to the complete paralysis of the black pieces.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="vel267" class="calibre3"></a>Also interesting was 16.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>d6, but after 16…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xd6 17.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xd6 f6, it becomes clear why Petrosian put his knight on b6. The exchange after 18.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>c4 would bring him some relief, although White would still have a very pleasant position.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, with 18.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>d3!?, White would retain his pressure. Relatively best is 18…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>b8 (the attempt to extricate himself by 18…e5?! fails to the very strong 19.a4! <span class="chessfont">♗</span>f5 (19…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xa4?? 20.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>a1 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>b6 21.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xb6) 20.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xb7 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>ad8 21.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xd8 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>xd8 22.a5, and White is virtually winning), but after 19.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>c5 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>e8, White again has different ways to make progress.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">16…g6</b></p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="vel268" class="calibre3"></a>Petrosian was always a specialist in ‘doing nothing’, i.e. he always knew how to find a move to strengthen his position, and at the same time wait and see what his opponent was planning. The text move looks sensible at least: he makes ‘luft’ for his king. And since White has a light-squared bishop, …h7-h6 would not be the way to go about this.</p>
<p class="noindent">The ‘eternal’ question we could pose also here is whether it wouldn’t have been better for Black to continue with 16…f6. After 17.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>c4 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>xc4 (here, 17…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>d5? loses to 18.e4 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>b4 19.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>b6, winning material) 18.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xc4, and since White’s major pieces threaten to invade the black premises, the issue is already almost decided.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">17.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>d3!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">White slowly strengthens his position. He prepares a possible doubling, and possibly he can occupy the d-file, with his queen behind the rook. The tactical justification of this rook move is not unimportant.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">17…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>d5</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Petrosian grabs his best chance. Another essential aspect of White’s last move is that 17…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>d8 could now be met with 18.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>c5!, as Black doesn’t have the rook swap on the d-file with check. This means that after 18…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xc5 19.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xd8+ <span class="chessfont">♕</span>f8 20.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xf8+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>xf8 21.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>c7, Black will collapse due to the weakness of the seventh rank. Please note how deplorable the black pieces are in comparison with the white pieces here.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">18.e4</b></p>
<p class="noindent">The knight is driven off, but this has one big disadvantage: the bishop on g2 becomes inactive for a while.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="vel64" class="calibre3"></a>Kasparov could also have opted for 18.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>d2, after which he would get control over the d-file. Also here, Black is in dire straits.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">18…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>b6</b></p>
<p class="noindent">The only move. Obviously, 18…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>b4? fails to 19.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xd5.</p>
<p class="noindent">The alternative 18…f6? loses immediately because of 19.exd5 fxe5 20.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>c7, and the black position collapses.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00778.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">19.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>f1!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Kasparov was highly satisfied with this move. Clearly, his intention was to immediately involve the bishop in the play. He could also have waited; something could be said for 19.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>dc3. By the way, there is another, quite deep, tactical motivation behind the text.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">19…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>e8</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Petrosian keeps playing passively. The main reason is that he prefers not to play …f7-f6, weakening the seventh rank. Probably, again, he didn’t fancy driving off the white knight. Indeed, after 19…f6, he would be facing the loss of a pawn after 20.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>c4 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>d7 21.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xb6 axb6 22.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xb6 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>c6 23.a3, and the rest is a matter of technique. By the way, in this position, Black cannot regain the pawn with 23…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xe4??, in view of 24.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>c7 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>e8 25.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>dd7, and with two white rooks on the seventh rank, the game is immediately over.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">20.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>dd1!</b></p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00779.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="noindent">The funny thing is that the rook, which had made this beautiful move to d3, now returns to its former position. It clears the way for the bishop, now definitively cornering Black.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">20…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>f8</b></p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="vel269" class="calibre3"></a>A clear sign that the black player cannot undertake anything. How must Petrosian have felt, being surrounded like this – exactly what he himself had done to so many opponents?</p>
<p class="noindent">On every turn, 20…f6 had to be examined. Here, after 21.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>c4 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>d7 (after 21…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xc4 22.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xc4, the threat of 23.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>c7 can no longer be parried) 22.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>d6! <span class="chessfont">♖</span>eb8 23.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>c7, Black could soon call it a day.</p>
<p class="noindent">It is essential that here also, 20…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>d8 does not work well in view of 21.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>c5!. We can see here why 19.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>f1! was such an important move. Again, Black cannot capture the rook on d1 with check, and so he is driven further into the corner.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">21.a3!</b></p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="vel65" class="calibre3"></a>Kasparov is showing some sadistic traits. Apart from the fact that this is a useful move, it also underlines Black’s utter helplessness.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">21…<span class="chessfont">♔</span>g7 22.b3</b></p>
<p class="noindent">The pawn on b3 takes all the squares from the knight on b6 (those that were available to it). White’s intention is to continue a3-a4-a5.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">22…<span class="chessfont">♔</span>g8 23.a4</b></p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00780.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">23…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>d8</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Now, he considers he should go for it after all.</p>
<p class="noindent">One might wonder what would have happened if Petrosian had persisted in ‘doing nothing’. The following plausible variation shows how soon Black would have been pushed over the edge in that case: 23…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>e8 24.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>b5!. Now, the deadly threat is a4-a5, since the knight on b6 has no squares. Black’s position is cracking at the seams, and White uses the features of the position in a beautiful way: on 24…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>b8, 25.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>c7! is a killer. If 24…f6, 25.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>c7! <span class="chessfont">♕</span>f8 26.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>g4 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>e7</p>

<p class="caption">Analysis diagram</p>
</div>
<p class="noindent">27.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xf6+!, and it is all over, as the following variation shows: 27…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xf6 28.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>d8+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>g7 29.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>e8! <span class="chessfont">♖</span>xc7 30.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>h8+, and Black gets mated.</p>
<p class="noindent">Or 23…<span class="chessfont">♔</span>g7 24.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>c3 <span class="chessfont">♔</span>g8 25.a5 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>d7 26.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>c7 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>d8 27.a6, and Black can throw in the towel.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">24.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>c5!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Of course, he had seen that move too, and therefore the former World Champion stopped the game here, not waiting for the painful finish that would follow after 24…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xc5 (24…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>e8 25.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>g4!) 25.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xd8+ <span class="chessfont">♕</span>f8 26.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xf8+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>xf8 27.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>c7. White not only threatens to win the f7-pawn, but also to play 28.a5, winning a piece. The continuation 27…f6 doesn’t help on account of 28.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>f7+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>g8 29.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xf6, and Black will lose even more material.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><a id="vel66" class="calibre3"></a>The way in which Kasparov had pushed the former World Champion with his back to the wall, giving him not the slightest chance to escape from the clutch, and cornering him in such a way that he could do nothing but shuffle his pieces to and fro – it all reminded me of the way Petrosian himself had beaten many of his opponents.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="vel23" class="calibre3"></a>Also, the professional way in which Kasparov converted his strategic advantage completely convinced me now. This was it – he was going to be the new World Champion. And that was what happened – even though, as it turned out later, Anatoly Karpov was of an entirely different calibre than the opponents in this event. But even Karpov had to succumb to this Hercules in the end.</p>
<p class="level"><b class="calibre1">24.7 Constriction</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Constricting an opponent, as we have demonstrated several times, does not evoke the best character traits in a man. A player who makes his opponent suffer so gravely has to be a sadist to a certain degree. Even though in my younger years I was reputed to be a sharp player, my results got better after I had studied games by the ‘controllers’, as I will call them here. And indeed, it does give some satisfaction if you manage to ensnare your opponent so tightly that he can’t ‘move a muscle’. I didn’t often succeed in this, but when I did, sometimes my opponent would even compliment me. At least that is what happened after a game with a very friendly fellow IM in the Netherlands, Erik Hoeksema. I used to feel uncomfortable in our mutual games. We both played in the same style, and it is difficult to play against yourself.</p>
<p class="noindent">Erik showed great sportsmanship when, right after the game, in which he had had to suffer ‘great pains’, he quipped that this one would probably end up in my collection of ‘Grooten classics’. That convinced me, dear reader, in my decision to present it also to you.</p>

<p class="noindent">After 8…exd5 9.exd5 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>g4, I had planned to continue with 10.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>a4+, because in principle White wants to exchange as few pieces as possible: 10…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>bd7 (10…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>d7 11.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>c2) 11.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>d2 (that’s the idea: the knight strives for c4) 11…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>e7 (not 11…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>b4?!, in view of 12.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>c6!, and Black is in big trouble) 12.h3 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>h5 13.g4 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>g6 14.f4!, and Black has big problems, since his pieces are very cramped.</p>

<p class="noindent"><a id="ch24inlevel3" class="calibre3"></a>Black has a problem with his queen’s bishop. With this developing move, Hoeksema intends to exchange a piece by …<span class="chessfont">♘</span>e4, so as to ‘get some air’. Black should have continued 12…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>bd7, after which I like 13.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>f4 best. Following 13…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>b6 14.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>e3, White gets what he wants after all. In a game Kovtun-Bedgarani, Voroshilovgrad 1989, White managed to win later on.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">13.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>f3!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Just like in the Benoni, at this point, White wants at all cost to prevent Black from carrying through his plan. If White succeeds, Black’s lack of space will start playing a role.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">13…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>bd7?</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Not realizing what is hanging above his head.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">14.g4!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">This wasn’t the kind of move Erik expected from me; I am not known as a player who makes such ‘crude’ pawn moves. In the present case, this push is very strong. White increases his space advantage, while the black bishop is starting to gasp for air.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">14…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>g6 15.g5</b></p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00784.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="noindent">The right idea. The pawn on g5 deprives no less than three black pieces of the f6-square! Moreover, the f6-knight has to retreat to the bad square e8, where it disrupts the cooperation between the rooks. Less good was the logical 15.h4 h6 16.g5 hxg5 17.hxg5 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>h7, when the pawn on g5 would come under fire, and for the moment White can do nothing with the open h-file.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">15…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>e8 16.h4 f6</b></p>
<p class="noindent">More or less forced, we could say. But 16…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>e5! would have been the lesser evil. If anything, Black forces an exchange of pieces with this move, which is in his favour: 17.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xe5 dxe5. Now, it is best for White to insert the move 18.h5 (during the game, I was wondering whether 18.d6 would be a good idea. However, after 18…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xd6 19.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xa8 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>xa8, Black has decent compensation for the exchange. The white king is anything but safe, and Black’s pieces are quite active now. In a practical game, I might even prefer Black here…) 18…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>f5 19.h6 g6, and now, yes: 20.d6 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>xd6 21.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xa8 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>xa8, but also here Black has sufficient compensation.</p>
<p class="noindent">Also possible is 16…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>b6, although with 17.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>e3!, White can now force his opponent to play the weakening pawn move he also played in the game.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">17.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>g4</b></p>
<p class="noindent">White directs his attention to the weak square e6, but with this he gives his opponent a chance that should not have been given. Perhaps 17.h5 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>f5 18.g6 was slightly more clever, although again, after 18…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>e5 19.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>e2 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>xc4 20.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xc4, Black can free himself by 20…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>d7.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">17…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>e5?</b></p>
<p class="noindent">At first, I wanted to exchange the knights, and then continue with h4-h5, but then I remembered the wise saying ‘Why release the tension if it isn’t immediately necessary?’. 17…f5 is no fun for Black for two reasons – after simply 18.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>f3, my opponent saw the <span class="chessfont">♘</span>c3-e2-f4-e6 manoeuvre coming, but the tough approach with 18.h5 might have been even better.</p>
<p class="noindent">After 17…fxg5!, White would have been wise to insert 18.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>e2. 18.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>e6+ first does not achieve much: 18…<span class="chessfont">♔</span>h8 19.hxg5 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>e5! 20.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xe5 dxe5, and Black has extricated himself. His miserable knight on e8 can go to the nice d6-square, from where it can even be played to d4 via f5.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00785.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">18.h5!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Very energetically played, but also very strong. I calculated a few variations, and saw a few mate pictures looming up. When I couldn’t find anything for Black, I decided to play the text move. Now, my opponent entered the think tank for something like 40 minutes, and managed to find a stunning defence – which, however, does not appear to provide a solution to the problem.</p>
<p class="noindent">Indeed, Black still holds after 18.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xe5?! fxe5 19.h5 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>f5 20.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xf5 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>xf5 21.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>g4, although White would have a significant strategic advantage thanks to his possession of the e4-square. But the vulnerable white king doesn’t make things any easier.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">18…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>f5!?</b></p>
<p class="noindent">I almost fell off my chair when I sat down at the board again and saw what he had played. This is a highly creative attempt to overcome Black’s problems. But even though the move is very original, it fails to save Black.</p>
<p class="indentv">A) Immediately losing is 18…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xc4?, in view of 19.hxg6 f5 20.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xh7 fxg4 21.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xg4, with unstoppable mate, for example: 21…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>c8 22.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>h8+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>xh8 23.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>h5+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>g8 24.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>h7#;</p>
<p class="indentv">B) 18…f5 does not save Black: 19.hxg6! (19.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xe5 is also good), and now:</p>
<p class="indentv">B1) 19…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xg4 is no solution: 20.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>e2!, and Black has no decent way to protect the e6-square: 20…hxg6 21.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>e6+ <span class="chessfont">♖</span>f7 22.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xg6</p>

<p class="noindent">(now, White threatens 23.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>h7+ followed by 24.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>h8) 22…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>d8 (to vacate the e7-square for the king, but it won’t help Black) 23.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>h7+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>f8, and, funnily enough, Black cannot do anything against White’s threat to put his rook on the e-file, catching the black king in a mating net. For example: 24.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>f4 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>b8 (running away with 24…<span class="chessfont">♔</span>e7 25.<span class="chessfont">♔</span>f1 <span class="chessfont">♔</span>d7 fails to 26.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>g6!, and it is over: 26…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>f8 27.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>e6#) 25.<span class="chessfont">♔</span>f1 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>b4 26.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>e1, after which 27.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>h8+ is a lethal check;</p>
<p class="indentv">B2) On 19…fxg4, White continues with 20.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xe5 dxe5 21.d6! (this line and square clearance is an important theme) 21…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>c6 (after 21…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xd6, the a2-g8 diagonal falls into White’s hands: 22.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>b3+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>h8 23.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xh7#) 22.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xh7 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>xd6 23.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xg4, with mate.</p>
<p class="indentv">C) Another important point is 18…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xg4 19.hxg6 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>c8 (not 19…f5?, in view of 20.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>e2! hxg6 21.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>e6+ <span class="chessfont">♖</span>f7 22.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xg6, with variations analogous to the ones given above) 20.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>e2! (20.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>b6 is nothing for White after 20…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>f5!) 20…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>f5 21.f4! <span class="chessfont">♘</span>c7 22.gxh7+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>h8 23.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>g1, and White wins the knight on g4. Nevertheless, Black is still playing in this position: 23…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>h2!? 24.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xh2 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>xd5 25.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xd5 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>xd5 26.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>e3 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>e4, and even though his material surplus is large, White has to be extremely careful to strike down Black’s initiative. He can achieve this with 27.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>g4!;</p>
<p class="indentv">D) The bishop retreat 18…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>f7 fails after 19.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xe5 fxe5 20.g6! hxg6 21.hxg6, and Black goes down: 21…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xg6 22.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>e6+ <span class="chessfont">♗</span>f7 23.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>h5! – the leitmotiv in this position.

<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">19.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xf5 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>xc4 20.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>e2 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>b6</b></p>
<p class="noindent">The last important moment in this game. Now, I calculated a variation in which I saw some new mate pictures on the horizon. But when the calculations started to become too intricate, I decided to just win in a positional way.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">21.g6!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">The human decision. Now that I have conquered the light squares, there is also the winning 21.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xh7+ – I suspected this, but the variations are quite complex: 21…<span class="chessfont">♔</span>xh7 (during the game, I thought 21…<span class="chessfont">♔</span>h8 was not so clear. With hindsight, 22.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>g6! turns out to be a simple win) 22.g6+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>g8 (22…<span class="chessfont">♔</span>h8 23.h6!) 23.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>e6+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>h8 24.h6 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>d7 25.hxg7+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>xg7, and now analysis proves that 26.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>e3! results in a forced mate in 6. Human players will first look at 26.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>h6+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>xg6 27.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>g1+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>xh6 (27…<span class="chessfont">♔</span>h7 28.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>e4+ f5 29.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>h1 – again, this pretty ‘queen retreat’ that forces the win), and now 28.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>e3+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>h7 29.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>e4+ f5 30.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>h1+ is a nice mating line!</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">21…h6</b></p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00787.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="noindent">A small exercise: how does White increase his advantage?</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">22.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>h4!!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">In my opinion, this is a wonderful move, which exposes Black’s helplessness. When I started evaluating it, I got a kind of kick, realizing that I was going to defeat a pretty good opponent in an attractive way. White puts three major pieces on a file, and wins a piece. The bishop on e7 cannot be protected three times, which means that the knight on e8 will perish. Black’s pieces are so unfortunately placed that there is no way for him to disentangle. If you thought of 22.<span class="chessfont">♔</span>f1 (with the same idea), you may also congratulate yourself.</p>
<p class="noindent">Of course, I briefly looked at 22.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>e6+, in order after 22…<span class="chessfont">♔</span>h8 to see whether White could achieve something by 23.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xh6 gxh6. But as I didn’t find a forced line immediately, I let this chance pass by. A true attacking player would curse himself if he hadn’t looked further here. And indeed: by opening more lines before the black king, there is a win on the horizon: 24.g7+! (24.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>e3? is no good, due to 24…<span class="chessfont">♔</span>g7) 24…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xg7 25.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>e3 <span class="chessfont">♔</span>h7 26.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>g3! (of course, such moves are not very difficult to find, but the problem is that you have to realize at an earlier stage that you have to search in this direction) 26…<span class="chessfont">♔</span>h8 27.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>g6, and Black can forget about the rest.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">22…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>a7</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Obviously, Black tries to defend in this way. 22…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>d8 23.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>e4 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>a7 24.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>f4 wouldn’t have helped either. White continues with the plan from the game (<span class="chessfont">♗</span>c1-f4, <span class="chessfont">♔</span>e1-f1 and <span class="chessfont">♖</span>a1-e1) and wins. Immediately losing is 22…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>d8, in view of 23.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>e4, and the knight on e8 is already lost.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">23.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>e4 <span class="chessfont">♔</span>h8</b></p>
<p class="noindent">There are simply no decent moves to be found for Black.</p>
<p class="noindent">Of course, it is still essential that 23…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>c8 still fails to 24.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xc8 (though the computer thinks that 24.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>f4! is even stronger!) 24…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xc8 25.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xe7, winning a piece.</p>

<p class="image"><img src="../images/00788.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="noindent">A pretty final position. Black resigned. He has no remedy to the two white threats:</p>
<p class="noindent">1) tripling on the e-file;</p>
<p class="noindent">2) the manoeuvre <span class="chessfont">♕</span>e2-d2 followed by <span class="chessfont">♗</span>xh6.</p>

The <span class="chessfont">♖</span>h5 is ‘permanently’ locked up and the <span class="chessfont">♗</span>h3 has to keep guarding the g4-square, since otherwise White could lock in the <span class="chessfont">♖</span>h5 by h2-h4 and sometimes g3-g4. But what is the most convincing way to convert these advantages into a full point?</p>
