<p class="chap1"><b class="calibre1">Training experiment</b></p>
<p class="level"><b class="calibre1">8.1 Introduction</b></p>
<p class="noindent">That positional play cannot be learned in one day is something we have established already. Before one can claim to have played a game according to the correct strategic lines, one should first delve deeply into the problems of middlegame positions.</p>
<p class="noindent">As a trainer I have noticed that acquiring knowledge and understanding of this matter is not an easy task. It is especially important to label the main themes in a position correctly, and to study several related examples. And even if the subject is clear, that is not to say that you will be able to apply the newly-acquired insights correctly on the next occasion. In this chapter I hope to tell you a little bit more about what we can do about this.</p>
<p class="level"><b class="calibre1">8.2 Good knight versus bad bishop</b></p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="ch8inlevel9" class="calibre3"></a>In Chapter 2 I dished up a position from the game Fischer-Gadia, Mar del Plata 1960, for you. To refresh your memory, we started with the following position:</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00218.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="noindent">From here White won the game because he had the huge advantage of good knight versus bad bishop. In Chapter 9 we will go deeper into creating and building upon such types of advantage. In my work as a trainer I have spent a lot of time on this theme. For players who have to further develop their strategic understanding, the theme of strong squares can provide a lot of insight. In my opinion, this subject lends itself perfectly to the development of a ‘feeling’ for positional play.</p>
<p class="noindent">With a quite considerable number of players, teaching an entirely different line of thinking turns out to be necessary in order to make real progress. It is my experience that many club players immediately start to calculate when they are looking at a position. They see ‘loose moves’ – variations. Such players find it difficult to develop a coherent concept. But in positional play, everything revolves around making plans and long-term thinking.</p>
<p class="noindent">A line of thinking where a player looks schematically at a position is indispensable for such an endgame. In this light, it is not surprising that in my own games I often get the advantage of good knight versus bad bishop. It’s not only that the subject has always held my interest, but if you spend much time on it, you will also automatically get it on the board more often.</p>
<p class="noindent">As a result, I have built up a certain reputation in this area in Holland – with youth players. And this stimulated me to accumulate a certain amount of exercise material on this subject and at least to take care that my pupils are familiarized with these problems. I was pleased every time I was sent a game where a pupil had succeeded in getting the theme on the board. And it was even better when that pupil had managed to score a point with it. Such things would allow me to sit back and smile with satisfaction.</p>
<p class="level"><b class="calibre1">8.3 The balance between strategy and tactics</b></p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="vel493" class="calibre3"></a>A position that is winning for a grandmaster, does not have to be winning at all for an inexperienced player. I myself have learned a lot by playing through games by strong players that had been annotated by themselves. For example, in my youth I picked up a lot from the book <i class="calibre4">The Art of Chess Analysis</i> by Jan Timman. It was interesting for me to watch a strong grandmaster like Timman describe how he unravelled the problems in a position. I found it instructive how he sometimes managed to gain complete control of a position on the basis of a superior pawn structure.</p>
<p class="noindent">I miss this strategic depth a little with many modern players. It is no rarity to find players flashing through games at high speed with their finger on the cursor key of their laptop. Sometimes I ask them if they can explain to me in words what happened in that game. And before they can give an answer, I ask them if they think they can understand within a few seconds the deeper backgrounds of a game on which two strong players have spent more than four hours thinking time.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="ch8inlevel11" class="calibre3"></a>These days chess has become much more dynamic. The sharpening of the struggle was initiated by Kasparov, and under the influence of players like Topalov and Shirov, attacking play has experienced a boom. But it always turns out that more strategically inclined players, such as for instance Kramnik and Giri, can hold their own at the highest level.</p>
<p class="noindent">Actually, both types of player are able to turn their hands on both styles. For even though Shirov has the reputation of being a tactician <i class="calibre4">par excellence</i>, there are plenty of games where he outclasses his opponents with small positional means. And from Kramnik we know that, although he likes to steer the game into strategic waters, he can also produce magnificent attacking games. Precisely with such great players, the balance between strategy and tactics is perfect.</p>
<p class="level"><b class="calibre1">8.4 Training experiment</b></p>
<p class="noindent">The above reflections lead us to the following game, which I have used for an interesting training experiment.</p>
<p class="game">SI 14.8 (B90)</p>
<p class="game1"><a id="ch8level1" class="calibre3"></a>Judit Polgar</p>
<p class="game1"><a id="ch8level2" class="calibre3"></a>Viswanathan Anand</p>
<p class="game2"><a id="ch8level3" class="calibre3"></a>Wijk aan Zee 1998 (6)</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">1.e4 c5 2.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>f3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xd4 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>f6 5.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>c3 a6 6.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>e3 e5 7.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>f3 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>e7 8.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>c4 0-0 9.0-0 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>e6</b></p>
<p class="noindent">This was a fashionable variation for a while, where both players engage in a dispute for the d5-square.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">10.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>e2</b></p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="ch8inlevel10" class="calibre3"></a>White usually plays 10.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>b3 here, which mostly leads to a position similar to the one in the game. By opting for this move order, Polgar provokes an action with …b7-b5, which may give her an important target later in the game, as we have seen in the game Fischer-Gadia.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">10…b5 11.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>b3</b></p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00219.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">11…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xb3?</b></p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="ch8inlevel1" class="calibre3"></a>GM Baburin writes: ‘This gives White more control in the centre and must therefore be considered very risky strategically.’ I would like to put it more strongly: this swap is a big strategic mistake, especially for a player of Anand’s calibre.</p>
<p class="noindent">A tactical blunder would be 11…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>bd7??. After 12.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xe6 fxe6 13.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>g5, Black loses a valuable pawn. The alternative 11…h6 is known from several games.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">12.axb3</b></p>
<p class="noindent">It is clear that Black will have problems with the d5-square. Moreover, White has gained control of the half-open a-file, and – as indicated above – the vulnerability of the queenside pawns may play a role.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">12…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>bd7 13.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>fd1 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>c7</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Probably 13…h6 should have been preferred, although this involves a weakening of the kingside. Now Judit engages in a battle for the d5-square.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">14.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>g5 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>fc8</b></p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00220.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">15.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>e1!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Protecting the pawn on c2 in a flexible way, so White can get on with her siege of the d5-square. The usual counterplay in the Sicilian, achieved by pressure on the c-file, is hereby reduced to a minimum.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">15…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>b7 16.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xf6 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>xf6 17.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>d5 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>xd5 18.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xd5</b></p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00221.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="noindent">The white player has managed to occupy the d5-square with a piece. Furthermore, she has achieved the ideal material balance: good knight versus bad bishop. The knight ‘only’ needs to be repositioned now, in order to increase the pressure on Black’s position. Of course the knight should not be exchanged for the bishop.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">18…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>c5 19.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>ad1 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>xd5 20.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xd5 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>c8</b></p>
<p class="noindent">According to Baburin, Black could have played 20…b4, fixing the pawn on c2 and creating counterplay along the c-file, but he immediately adds that this move would weaken even more light squares.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00222.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">21.c3!</b></p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="vel301" class="calibre3"></a>A beautiful, strategically sound move with several intentions. For example, Polgar prevents Black obtaining counterplay on the c-file, and she vacates the c2-square for the knight, which can now head for the beautiful square d5.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">21…b4</b></p>
<p class="noindent">21…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>c5 is simply met by 22.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>d1, when Black cannot liberate himself with 22…d5? in view of 23.b4!, winning the pawn on d5.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">22.c4 g6 23.g3 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>c5 24.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>d1 a5 25.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>c2 <span class="chessfont">♔</span>g7 26.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>d3 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>c6 27.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>e3 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>c8 28.<span class="chessfont">♔</span>g2 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>e6 29.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>e2 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>d8 30.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>d5</b></p>
<p class="noindent">The knight has arrived on the d5-square, enabling White to get a firm grip on the position. Thus, she has achieved the main strategic aim of putting the knight on the strong d5-square, versus a bad bishop. To make further progress White will have to set up an attack, making full use of this strong knight.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">30…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>c5 31.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>e3 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>e7 32.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>d3 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>d8 33.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>d2 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>c6 34.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>d1 <span class="chessfont">♔</span>g8 35.h4 <span class="chessfont">♔</span>g7</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Sometimes, adopting a wait-and-see attitude is the right approach. But here Black shouldn’t have waited while White makes further progress on the kingside. Better was 35…h5.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">36.h5</b></p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="vel191" class="calibre3"></a>This follows Nimzowitsch’s strategy to create two (or more) weaknesses.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">36…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>g5 37.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>f3 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>c8 38.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>d1 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>c6 39.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>e2 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>c8 40.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>h1 <span class="chessfont">♔</span>g8 41.f3</b></p>
<p class="noindent">A subtle continuation, with which Polgar intends to realize several ideas. She has vacated the f2-square for the queen (to introduce <span class="chessfont">♕</span>f2-a7 into the position), and the queen can also be deployed on the other side of the board (<span class="chessfont">♕</span>e2-f2-g1-h2).</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">41…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>b8 42.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>f2 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>b7</b></p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="ch8inlevel2" class="calibre3"></a>Anand also achieves a sound set-up. The rook prevents the penetration of White’s queen on the queenside, and at the same time it (indirectly) keeps an eye on h7.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00223.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">43.hxg6 fxg6</b></p>
<p class="noindent">After the recapture with the other pawn, 43…hxg6, White can realize her other idea with 44.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>g1. After 44…f5 (or 44…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>f6 45.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>h2 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>g7 46.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>h4! <span class="chessfont">♖</span>b8 47.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>a1!, and Black will not be able to keep his position together) 45.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>h2 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>f6 46.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>h6 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>g7 47.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>g5 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>d7 48.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>a1, Black again has no answer to White’s play on two wings.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">44.c5!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Now that the black kingside has been weakened, White turns to the queenside.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">44…dxc5 45.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xc5 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>d8 46.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>c1 <span class="chessfont">♔</span>f7 47.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>e3 <span class="chessfont">♔</span>g7 48.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>c4 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>d7 49.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>c1</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Polgar systematically increases the pressure. She keeps a permanent grip on the position and does not allow any counterplay. Black is condemned to reacting.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">49…h5 50.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>c6 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>d6 51.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>c8</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Slowly but surely, the white pieces force an entry into the black position. The black bishop is still utterly powerless.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">51…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>d7 52.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>c5 <span class="chessfont">♔</span>h6</b></p>
<p class="noindent">An interesting counter was 52…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>b6. However, White plays 53.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>c4, keeping total control of the position. Only not 53.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xb6 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>d2+ 54.<span class="chessfont">♔</span>g1 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>d1+ 55.<span class="chessfont">♔</span>g2 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>d2+, and Black escapes with perpetual check.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">53.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>b8</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Judit remains focused on preventing her opponent’s counterplay. By the way, she could also have opted for 53.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>a8, since 53…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>b6? will end badly for Black after 54.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>c1+ (certainly not 54.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xb6? <span class="chessfont">♖</span>d2+ and Black again achieves perpetual check) 54…<span class="chessfont">♔</span>g7 55.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>g5 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>d4 (or 55…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>e6 56.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xb6 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>xb6 57.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xe5+ <span class="chessfont">♖</span>f6 58.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>a6, and White wins. After 55…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>e6 56.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xb6 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>xb6 57.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>a7+, all resistance is also broken) and now 56.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>e7! is very strong, with the original follow-up 56…<span class="chessfont">♔</span>f7 57.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>g8!, and Black runs out of moves.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00224.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">53…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>f6</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Curiously, after the extremely ‘ugly’ move 53…g5, the position does not offer an immediate decision. True, Black puts another pawn on the wrong colour, but at the same time he rules out the annoying <span class="chessfont">♕</span>c1 check. Presumably White should now try to exchange all the major pieces, since the knight versus bishop ending almost certainly wins: 54.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>a8 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>b6 55.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>c4 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>d8.</p>
<p class="noindent">On 53…<span class="chessfont">♔</span>g7, 54.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>b7! <span class="chessfont">♕</span>xb7 55.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xd6 is a favourable liquidation for White. The combination of queen plus (strong) knight will beat the queen-(bad) bishop tandem.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">54.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>e3+ <span class="chessfont">♗</span>g5?</b></p>
<p class="noindent">A mistake in a lost position. But also after the superior 54…<span class="chessfont">♔</span>g7 White would be virtually winning with 55.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>a8!.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">55.f4!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">This push, which Judit has postponed as long as possible, as she didn’t want to make her own king vulnerable, now comes with great power.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">55…exf4 56.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>h8+</b></p>
<p class="rights"><b class="calibre1">1-0</b></p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="ch8inlevel3" class="calibre3"></a>Anand surrendered, as he had also seen that after 56…<span class="chessfont">♔</span>g7 57.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>d4+ <span class="chessfont">♗</span>f6 White strikes home with the beautiful sacrifice 58.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xf6+! <span class="chessfont">♖</span>xf6 59.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>h7+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>xh7, and the knight has the final word: 60.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xf6+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>g7 61.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xd7.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><a id="vel302" class="calibre3"></a>What is so instructive about this game? A tactically very proficient player by nature like Judit Polgar manages to force no less an opponent than Viswanathan Anand into a strategically hopeless position. Then an endless manoeuvring phase follows, where Judit strengthens her position step by step. The first task she sets herself is to play her knight via e1 to d5, after which she holds the position in a firm grasp. When she has managed to put her knight on the dream square by subtle manoeuvres, a new phase is entered.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="ch8inlevel4" class="calibre3"></a>In this phase she succeeds in creating weaknesses for the opponent on two wings. Black is forced to pull out all the stops in order not to be overrun, and then Polgar opens the position along the c-file, where she then reigns supreme. All her actions are in the style of the great masters, of whom Tigran Petrosian is probably the shining example. Without allowing a shred of counterplay, she increases her advantages. When Anand is brought down to his knees and makes a tactical mistake at the end, Polgar turns the switch and tackles him with a magnificent tactical turn. It is no mean feat to render a great player like Anand powerless like this, but Polgar has managed to produce a virtually perfect game.</p>
<p class="noindent">I wondered if this wouldn’t be highly instructive for four youth players that I trained in a group, as part of a project sponsored by the Stichting Bevordering Schaaksport Nederland (Dutch Foundation for the Promotion of Chess). I was to train and coach four talented 12-year-old boys for about three years. Since the hours of contact were relatively scarce, and the travelling distances were relatively large, I decided to strive for a high training intensity by playing out the position below against them via email.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00225.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="noindent">The youngster had White and I was going to defend this position with black. Of course, they were meant to try and convert their indisputable advantage in this position into other concrete advantages. For this purpose, I had looked at various examples with them, and given them exercise material on the subject at home. I could expect them to be well-prepared!</p>
<p class="noindent">The arrangement was that at least three to five times a week a move would be played, and that they would put this position on the board at home, in order to imitate a normal game situation as closely as possible. Additionally, it was arranged that they obviously wouldn’t use a computer (i.e., no engine, and no consulting databases either). Of course I had to rely on their honesty, but I was sure I could count on that, since all four of them were very ambitious boys, and of course they knew that they would only be fooling themselves.</p>
<p class="noindent">Since I would have to defend a bad position in four games at a time, I had arranged that I would sporadically turn on a chess computer if waging the defence would become too much for me to handle. For this purpose I now and then used the chess program ‘The King’, an engine that had been built into the database program Tascbase; unfortunately this is a DOS-program that cannot be used nowadays under the newest Windows versions. By the way, the program wasn’t of much help to me, since we had a predominantly strategic position, in which the program frequently gave wrong assessments. To be honest, I have to say that in one game, where the position suddenly exploded and things got very tactical, the computer put me on the right track and I found the right way to play.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="ch8inlevel7" class="calibre3"></a>Of these four talents, three have developed very strongly many years later. Wouter Spoelman and Twan Burg have become grandmasters, and Vincent Rothuis an international master. The fourth, Egbert Clevers, gave priority to his professional education, but he is still a respectable club player.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="ch8inlevel6" class="calibre3"></a>The latter, by the way, withdrew from the project after one year, and he was replaced by the 13-year-old Ali Bitalzadeh, who also bagged the international master title later.</p>
<p class="noindent">That this group became so successful was in the first place the merit of the players themselves. All four of them were highly motivated to focus entirely on their chess study, and they invested many hours in it. Besides, they had not been selected for nothing – their talent had stood out before. It was the task of the trainer to set them to some sound work, and playing out this game was one of the routines that I opted for.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Below I give the four games that were played, with the comments and analyses that we made afterwards.</p>

<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">1.b4!?</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Wouter meets one criterion in this position, namely preventing Black’s counterplay along the c-file. The downside of this move is that the b4-square is no longer available for the knight.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">1…g6 2.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>d3?!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">The queen is in the way here, since the rook will later have to vacate the square d5 for the knight.</p>

<p class="noindent"><a id="ch8inlevel5" class="calibre3"></a>A positionally attractive move (like in the stem game Polgar-Anand) would fail here for tactical reasons: 14.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>e3? <span class="chessfont">♗</span>xh4, and now 15.gxh4?? is not possible in view of 15…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>g4+.</p>

<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">15…f5 16.exf5!?</b></p>
<p class="noindent">I would not have played this myself, but it works out well. White voluntarily gives up his control of the light squares, and he also mobilizes the black pawn centre, making the bishop better than it is now. The upside is that Black’s king position becomes exposed, as a result of which Vincent gets chances against the enemy monarch.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">16…gxf5 17.f4</b></p>

<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">20…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>c8 21.g4?</b></p>
<p class="noindent">An incredible pawn sacrifice that only barely fails to work in White’s favour.

<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">21…fxg4 22.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>f8?!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">White is now really starting to gamble, allowing Black to save his skin thanks to a cunning defence. 22.f5+ <span class="chessfont">♕</span>xf5 23.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>g8+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>h6 24.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>h8+ would have forced a draw, but Vincent tries for more.</p>

<p class="noindent">Another pawn moves to the right colour, but White shouldn’t overdo things. The weakening of the dark squares will later prove to work against White.</p>
<p class="noindent">The idea to play the knight via g2 to e3 is nice, but for that purpose he has to be able to kick the bishop from g5. If White wants to pursue this plan, 1.g3 is more normal.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">1…b4</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Perhaps I should have preferred …<span class="chessfont">♖</span>c6 first, making …<span class="chessfont">♗</span>d8 and …<span class="chessfont">♗</span>b6 possible.</p>

<p class="noindent1">What conclusions should we draw from this? The results are rather disappointing for the young talents. But after the games I immediately put this into perspective for them. One by one they had played well in certain phases of the game. This is another important thing when coaching players: you should turn their mistakes and omissions into something positive. Thus, I would never utter the word ‘wrong’ as a matter of principle. I would rather speak of a ‘learning opportunity’.</p>
<p class="noindent">In the collective analysis afterwards, it became clear that Vincent should even have won, and that the others certainly wouldn’t have lost if they hadn’t tried so hard for a win.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="vel568" class="calibre3"></a>By the way, this fighting spirit does them credit; I had told them that they would develop their play if in their games they would fight on in positions that looked ‘equal’. Today it is not easy to learn good endgame technique, as many games must be rattled off at an accelerated tempo, under great time pressure. However, it is precisely the analysis of endgames that is highly instructive, and I remember that my teacher Cor van Wijgerden always said that you will play the middlegame better if you have a better understanding of the endgame.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="ch8inlevel8" class="calibre3"></a>There is one important lesson to be drawn from these four training games: three of the four boys didn’t manage to get a knight on d5 without any relevant changes in the structure. Twan Burg could have played his knight there, but then he had already swapped rooks on c5, and solved the weakness of the pawn on d6.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="vel305" class="calibre3"></a>I have explicitly tried to demonstrate the patience and subtlety of Polgar’s play, which is necessary in such a position. A second point of improvement was that, when Polgar had finally settled the knight on the strong square, careful manoeuvring was still required. The strategy of playing on both wings, creating two weaknesses, was deemed highly instructive by all four pupils.</p>
<p class="noindent">But also in the analysis it turned out that the inclination with these 12-year-olds to ‘start some action’ had to be suppressed in this type of position. Otherwise, I only wanted to stimulate the youthful zest they all had! In any case, it was useful to see how Polgar only made a ‘raw pawn move’ like f3-f4 when it won almost on the spot.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="vel124" class="calibre3"></a>Imagine my surprise when a few years later I paid a visit to the Amsterdam Chess Tournament. When I entered the playing hall I looked at the demonstration boards, with the positions of the games that were being played. Before I got the opportunity to look closer at any of the games, I noticed a broad grin on the face of the still very young Wouter Spoelman. With a 2277 rating he was up against the slightly older, also very talented Dutch master Erwin l’Ami, who then had a FIDE rating of 2486 to his name. A few years later l’Ami even became a strong grandmaster, who managed to achieve a 2600+ rating.</p>
<p class="noindent">After I had cast a glance at the demonstration board, I immediately understood why Wouter looked round the room with such a big smile on his face.</p>

<p class="noindent">In this position the proud knight is sure as fate on d4. Black has a bishop, of which he cannot really make any good use. With his following move</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">1.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>h2!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">White activates one of his two rooks. This way he hopes to increase the pressure along the b-file, and possibly also on the c4-pawn.</p>

<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">3.a5 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>xd4</b></p>
<p class="noindent">A desperate attempt, and White makes short work of it.

<p class="noindent">And White had robbed the position of all prospects for Black. On move 60 Spoelman had conquered his master scalp. When I congratulated him on his win after the game, he replied: ‘You taught me!’ There is no greater compliment for a trainer, I guess…</p>
