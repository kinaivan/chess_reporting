<p class="level"><b class="calibre1">17.1 Introduction</b></p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="vel17" class="calibre3"></a>Outsiders often talk about the chess world being chiefly a collection of eccentrics. Even though the game of chess enjoys a positive image, outsiders will always express their surprise at the parapsychologist and the yoghurt cups from the notorious World Championship match between Karpov and Kortchnoi in Baguio City (Philippines) in 1978.</p>
<p class="noindent">Even so, the extravagant behaviour of top-level players appeals to the imagination of non-chess players. Whether professional players are pleased with this, is a moot question. They are already trying hard to get rid of the stuffy image of chess as a boring game that is played only by elderly gentlemen smoking big cigars.</p>
<p class="noindent1">What I do know is that anyone who is once ‘caught’ by the game, is ‘lost’ forever. A player who likes the game will never throw his chessboard out of the window, even though he may often feel an irresistible urge to do so, on one of those days when he has blundered horribly in a completely winning position. The true chess player is addicted to the game, even though ‘you never get used to losing’, as Donner used to say. Playing through a beautiful endgame study, or solving one, stirs up powerful emotions, which will soon help a ‘broken man’ back on his feet.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><a id="ch17inlevel1" class="calibre3"></a>Take a look at the following study:</p>

<p class="noindent">Clearly, White has the advantage, in spite of the material disadvantage of two pieces versus queen. The black king is badly placed, but especially the queen is in a tight spot.</p>
<p class="noindent">With his following move White forces both black pieces into even greater inactivity.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">1.a5+! <span class="chessfont">♔</span>b7</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Forced, since after 1…<span class="chessfont">♔</span>xa5 2.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>c6+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>b6 3.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xa7 <span class="chessfont">♔</span>xa7, White wins the ensuing ending easily with 4.<span class="chessfont">♔</span>e5.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">2.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>c6</b></p>
<p class="noindent">The queen is literally and figuratively driven into a corner.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">2…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>a8</b></p>
<p class="noindent">As we can also see elsewhere in this book, at the moment when a piece is out of play, the opponent will try to bring it back into the game again. Such is the case here: Black threatens to escape with his queen, after which he could cash in on his material advantage. But White has a fantastic parade up his sleeve:</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">3.<span class="chessfont">♔</span>g7!!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">And Black is in zugzwang. The only thing he can do is give the queen for only one of White’s minor pieces.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Solving studies might just be the best remedy for a horrible defeat. Especially if you manage to find the solution by yourself, this will boost your confidence. Besides, it may also make you remember why you are playing chess in the first place!</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="vel453" class="calibre3"></a>In the above study, we saw something of instructive value. A piece was out of play, and White exploited this detail aptly. Steinitz already told us that a piece which is not on the battlefield, is out of play. With the battlefield, we mean the part of the board where the battle takes place. This forces the other side to act energetically, if he wants to take profit from this temporary advantage. The following game aptly illustrates this battle method.</p>
<p class="game2t"><a id="ch17level1" class="calibre3"></a>Alexander Kotov</p>
<p class="game1"><a id="ch17level2" class="calibre3"></a>Mark Taimanov</p>
<p class="game2"><a id="ch17level3" class="calibre3"></a>Zürich ct 1953 (11)</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00536.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="noindent">About this position, Kotov writes in his book <i class="calibre4">Play like a Grandmaster</i>: ‘Black’s position looks quite reasonable, but it has one outstanding defect. His knight at a5 is badly placed and has little prospect of getting to a good square. White plans to exploit this by playing all his pieces to the K-side in order to work with an extra piece there.’</p>
<p class="noindent">In his other book, <i class="calibre4">Think like a Grandmaster</i>, Kotov describes his line of thinking in more detail: ‘In deciding on a plan, or more accurately how to continue from here, I set myself an aim that was not very complicated, but was strategically correct. I argued that I could not exploit the knight’s position directly, so I would have to exploit the fact that it was cut off from the kingside, as in attacking the king I would have an extra piece at my disposal compared to the defender. Simple and clear. Now follow how this important positional factor was used in the game.’</p>
<p class="noindent">Whatever the case may be, Kotov is able to comfortably carry out his above-mentioned plan, and his assessment is proved correct.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">1.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>h4!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">With this knight sortie White gives the signal for the storm that is to break out on the kingside.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">1…a6 2.a4 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>a7 3.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>f5 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>f8 4.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>e4</b></p>
<p class="noindent">White is careful with piece exchanges, but he is prepared to exchange these knights. The black knight on f6 is an important defender, and at the same time White vacates the e4-square for his bishop.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">4…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xe4 5.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xe4 b6</b></p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00537.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">6.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>d1!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">The minor pieces are already more or less pointed at the black king – now only the queen has to join them.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">6…axb5 7.axb5 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>d7 8.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>h5 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>e6</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Black cannot permit himself the exchange 8…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xf5; for example, 9.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xf5 g6 10.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>d5 <span class="chessfont">♔</span>g7 11.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>f4 does not inspire much confidence. White’s powerful bishop pair can be deployed over the entire board.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">9.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>f4</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Both players overlook a curious tactical intermezzo. The right move was 9.<span class="chessfont">♔</span>g2, to leave the vulnerable back rank with his king.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00538.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">9…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>b3?!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Finally, Black’s unfortunate knight puts in an appearance. However, it is too late. For the time being, the knight only attacks ‘empty’ squares, which White has abandoned a few moves ago, whereas White has a concrete target: the black king. At the moment, the knight is not capable of operating in the vicinity of White’s king, mainly because the white army is fully mobilized.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, there was a hidden possibility with which Black could have turned things around: 9…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xc4! 10.dxc4 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>a1+ 11.<span class="chessfont">♔</span>g2 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>xc4, and suddenly Black has launched a strong attack on the white king. The pressure that White exerts on the black king is just enough to allow him to escape with perpetual check: 12.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xh6+ (certainly not 12.h4??, as 12…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>f1+ 13.<span class="chessfont">♔</span>h2 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>xf2+ 14.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>g2 g6 15.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xh6+ <span class="chessfont">♗</span>xh6 16.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xh6 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>d5 is winning for Black) 12…gxh6 13.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>g4+ <span class="chessfont">♗</span>g7 14.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>c8+ <span class="chessfont">♗</span>f8 15.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>g4+ with move repetition.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">10.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>d1</b></p>
<p class="noindent">White is not afraid to enter an endgame. By the way, here also, 10.<span class="chessfont">♔</span>g2 deserved attention.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">10…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>a2</b></p>
<p class="noindent">After 10…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>a1 11.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xa1 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>xa1 12.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>c7, pawn b6 will be lost, after which Black is left with a hopeless endgame.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00539.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">11.h4</b></p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="vel105" class="calibre3"></a>Kotov is calling up reinforcements in order to further besiege the black king’s position.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">11…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>a1</b></p>
<p class="noindent">The knight is still wandering aimlessly in no man’s land.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">12.h5 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>c2 13.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>e5</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Slowly but surely, White manoeuvres his pieces in front of Black’s rather deserted king’s position. The threats have already become so strong that the black player no longer has a defence against them.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">13…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>b2</b></p>
<p class="noindent">After a move like 13…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>a3, there follows 14.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>g4 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>d2 15.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>f4 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>e1+ 16.<span class="chessfont">♔</span>g2, which would already force an immediate decision.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">14.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>c7</b></p>
<p class="noindent">The problem for Black is not only the menacing attack on his king, but also the weak b6-pawn on the queenside. By the way, White could have made this bishop move one move earlier. However, the immediate attempt to catch Black napping with 14.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>g4 did have a drawback: with 14…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>c1+ 15.<span class="chessfont">♔</span>h2 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>d2 Black can hold for the time being.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">14…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>a3 15.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>g4</b></p>
<p class="noindent">The white player still keeps confidence in his attack on the king. There was no argument against 15.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xb6 either.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">15…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>c1+ 16.<span class="chessfont">♔</span>g2</b></p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00540.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">16…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>b1</b></p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="vel106" class="calibre3"></a>Kotov here writes that ‘such moves are clear evidence that a catastrophe is near’.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="ch17inlevel2" class="calibre3"></a>Bronstein, who comments on this game in his invaluable tournament book, cannot help expressing a little irony: ‘The knight wanders forlornly about the corner of the board, as if trying to perform the well-known Knight’s Tour, while White methodically increases the pressure on the black king’s position.’</p>
<p class="noindent">Incidentally, also after 16…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>c2 17.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>e2, there would have been no salvation for Black.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">17.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>f4 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>d2?</b></p>
<p class="noindent">A grave mistake, which ends the game immediately. The following beautiful and instructive attacking sequence, starting after 17…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>c2 18.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xh6+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>h8, proves how dangerous White’s initiative already was:</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00541.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="noindent">19.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xf7+! (a surprising knight sacrifice) 19…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xf7 20.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>f5 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>g8 21.h6!.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">18.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>e2</b></p>
<p class="rights"><b class="calibre1">1-0</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Winning the piece is now the simplest way to enforce capitulation.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><a id="ch17inlevel7" class="calibre3"></a>The crystal-clear strategy displayed by Kotov in this game appealed to me when I saw it for the first time. He regards the black knight on a5 as a liability, and on that basis he transfers all his pieces as quickly as possible to the other wing, convinced that the preponderance of one extra piece should produce something concrete for him. Thus, he labelled the kingside as the battlefield. In the game Smyslov-Fischer in Chapter 20, we will witness a similar strategy.</p>
<p class="noindent1">In any case, it is clear that this concept is applicable in more than one type of position. The following game illustrates this.</p>
<p class="game2t"><a id="ch17level4" class="calibre3"></a>José Raul Capablanca</p>
<p class="game1"><a id="ch17level5" class="calibre3"></a>Efim Bogoljubow</p>
<p class="game2"><a id="ch17level6" class="calibre3"></a>London 1922 (6)</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00542.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="noindent">Capablanca decides to exile the black bishop to a faraway place.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">1.g4! <span class="chessfont">♗</span>g6 2.f5 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>h7</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Here Capablanca probably thought: ‘Right, that piece won’t do anything on that side of the board for the next twenty moves’.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">3.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>g3 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>e5 4.<span class="chessfont">♔</span>g2 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>ab8 5.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>ab1</b></p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00543.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">5…f6</b></p>
<p class="noindent">It won’t do any harm to spend some time studying the consequences of this pawn move. In the long run Black hopes to ‘bring the h7-bishop to life’ with the manoeuvre …<span class="chessfont">♗</span>h7-g8-f7-e8, after which it will rejoin the battle on the queenside. But for this he will have to make a huge concession: the surrender of the e6-square gives White a new angle to handle this position. Black cannot prevent a white knight from jumping to this square, where it will be so dominant that it must be exchanged. Then the protected passed pawn on e6 will be the new weapon in White’s arsenal.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">6.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>f3 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>b2+ 7.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xb2 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>xb2+ 8.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>e2 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>b3</b></p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00544.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="noindent">At first sight, Black is not doing so badly. He has a strong knight on c5, the only open file is in his possession, and he has an a-pawn that may give White some headaches. Capablanca himself indicated that the black pieces have more freedom than the white ones. Moreover, White has weak pawns on c4 and e4, and if there were no other factors playing a role here, White would not be in good shape.</p>
<p class="noindent">Nevertheless, Black is on the verge of losing. On the queenside he is playing practically with a piece less, as his bishop on h7 cannot assist its fellow pieces on the battlefield. And this sole factor is of overriding importance here.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">9.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>d4!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">White gives up the c-pawn in order to activate his pieces. The knight strives for the e6-square, as we predicted.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">9…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xe3</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Black could hardly go for 9…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xc4 10.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>e6 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>b8 11.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xc5 dxc5 12.d6, when the white d-pawn becomes much too dangerous.</p>

<p class="noindent">White places his knight on the coveted square.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">14…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>b3</b></p>
<p class="noindent">After the exchange of knights, with a protected passed white pawn on e6, the black bishop would have no hope of ever being able to make an appearance on the queenside.</p>
<p class="noindent">With 14…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xe4 Black would be jumping from the frying pan into the fire: after 15.<span class="chessfont">♔</span>xe4 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>xe2+ 16.<span class="chessfont">♔</span>d3 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>h2 17.<span class="chessfont">♔</span>d4 h5 (exchanging rooks with 17…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>d2+ 18.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>d3 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>xd3+ 19.<span class="chessfont">♔</span>xd3 also results in a hopeless endgame) 18.c5, White breaks through, and soon he will manage to escort a pawn to the other side. Note how hard it is for the black bishop to join the battle.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">15.c5!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Here also, White comes up with this breakthrough.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">15…dxc5 16.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xc5 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>d2+</b></p>
<p class="noindent">After 16…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xc5, Black will soon be in insurmountable trouble: 17.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xc5 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>b3+ 18.<span class="chessfont">♔</span>f4 a3 19.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>a5, and the white pieces cooperate much better than the black ones.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">17.<span class="chessfont">♔</span>f2</b></p>
<p class="noindent">White must remain on his guard. After 17.<span class="chessfont">♔</span>e3? a3, 18.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xa3? is not possible in view of 18…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>c4+.</p>

<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">19…a3?</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Black does not wish to part with his foremost a-pawn, as then he would have no counterplay left at all. As a consequence, White’s d-pawn now also becomes a killer, which will soon be Black’s undoing. But also after 19…<span class="chessfont">♔</span>d6 20.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xa4 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>b4 21.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>ac3 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>xc3 22.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xc3, White would slowly make progress.

<p class="noindent1">Coincidentally, that strong e6-square from the previous fragment also plays the leading part in another game by Capablanca. The similarity between both games is striking.</p>

<p class="noindent">It will hopefully be clear by now that even a slightly misplaced piece can backfire on you in a game. That it can even cost you the game is less obvious. During my search for examples the following incident came to my mind.</p>
<p class="noindent">When I had qualified for the first time for the Dutch Championship in 1981, I kept my eyes and ears open during my first encounter with the then top Dutch players. I tried to watch as many post-mortems as possible to increase my understanding. I remember drawing up a chair at the post-mortem of the following game, and witnessing how the Dutch master Rob Hartoch was being made something of a laughing-stock by the greatest loudmouth among the chess players in our country: the late grandmaster Jan Hein Donner.</p>
<p class="noindent">In his youth Hartoch had been considered the crown prince of Dutch chess. Already at the age of fifteen he was of master strength thanks to his good strategic understanding, and his fine shared 2nd place in the junior World Championship of 1965 seemed to be the signal of a bright future.</p>

<p class="image"><img src="../images/00551.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="noindent">In this position, Black has conceived the plan of exploiting the weak b4-square.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">1…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>8d7 2.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>g1 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>b8 3.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>aa1 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>a6 4.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>af1 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>b4 5.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>b1</b></p>
<p class="noindent">After a time-consuming manoeuvre, the knight has arrived on b4, where it is doing practically nothing. All White’s pieces are on the kingside, and he has his hands free to build up a dangerous initiative there.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">5…<span class="chessfont">♔</span>h8</b></p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00552.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="noindent">Here Donner started to make fun of Black’s action. With a certain disdain he uttered words like: ‘The battle takes place on the kingside and now you’re going to take a knight from its defensive post on f8 and simply put it out of play on the other side of the board!’</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">6.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>h2?!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">But Donner hardly manages to make good use of the opportunity himself. Probably he should have played 6.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>e1.</p>

<p class="noindent1">This leads us to the question how we are to exploit such an advantage. After a piece has been misplaced, the other player should point his arrows at the other wing. As a rule, he does not have to fear piece exchanges.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="vel243" class="calibre3"></a>In the following game, a bishop is rendered inactive for a large part of the game. It is highly instructive how the great strategist Petrosian manages to maintain this advantage until deep in the endgame, and to convert it into other advantages.</p>

<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">17…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>d8</b></p>

<p class="noindent"><a id="ch17inlevel3" class="calibre3"></a>Now that Black has released his hold of the f7-point, Petrosian tries to attack it in order to provoke weaknesses. However, Bronstein indicates a plan that would have been more to the point: 18.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>c1!, intending c4-c5 followed by <span class="chessfont">♘</span>e5-c4, so as to get more grip on the d-file.</p>
<p class="noindent">Also interesting is 18.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>f3!?, intending to start combinational play.

<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">36…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>c7</b></p>
<p class="noindent">In <i class="calibre4">Petrosian’s Best Games 1946-63</i>, P.H. Clarke indicates that Black could have put up more resistance with 36…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>g8.</p>

<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">38.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xd5</b></p>
<p class="noindent">White now deliberately opts for an attack with opposite-coloured bishops. In spite of the reduced material, his winning chances have increased.</p>

<p class="image"><img src="../images/00567.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="noindent">Here the game was adjourned, and during the break, Petrosian searched for the right set-up for his pieces. It is clear that the only thing he has to watch out for is that Black may force perpetual check in one way or another.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">41…<span class="chessfont">♔</span>e8 42.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>f6 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>b3+ 43.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>c3 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>d1 44.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>h8+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>d7 45.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>b8 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>c1+</b></p>
<p class="noindent">The crucial question is how White should react to 45…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>g1+. With 46.<span class="chessfont">♔</span>d2 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>f2+ 47.<span class="chessfont">♔</span>d1 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>f1+ 48.<span class="chessfont">♔</span>c2 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>e2+ 49.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>d2, he reaches the position that also arises in the game.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">46.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>d2 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>g1+ 47.<span class="chessfont">♔</span>d3 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>f1+</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Black cannot activate his bishop with 47…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>g6+, since after 48.f5 exf5 49.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>d6+, he would lose it.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">48.<span class="chessfont">♔</span>c2</b></p>
<p class="noindent">The queen is forced to give assistance to the defence from a passive square.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">48…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>a6</b></p>
<p class="noindent">After 48…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>c4+ 49.<span class="chessfont">♔</span>b2 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>d4+ 50.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>c3 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>f2+ 51.<span class="chessfont">♔</span>a3, the annoying checks are over.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00568.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">49.h5!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">White seems to make a running gag of his endeavour to give the bishop on f7 as little space as possible. At the same time he fixes the black h-pawn on a dark square, so that later on he can comfortably exchange queens, since in the opposite-coloured bishops endgame the pawn on h6 will be an easy prey for his bishop. The fact that Black can now start a new series of checks cannot hurt White in the least. He has accurately puzzled out that his bishop provides a good shield against the shower of checks.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">49…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>a2+ 50.<span class="chessfont">♔</span>d3 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>b1+ 51.<span class="chessfont">♔</span>e2 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>e4+ 52.<span class="chessfont">♔</span>f2 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>d4+ 53.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>e3 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>xb4</b></p>
<p class="noindent">After 53…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>b2+ 54.<span class="chessfont">♔</span>g3, an ‘echo’ of the variation given at move 48 ensues, where the white king escaped via a3.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00569.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">54.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>f8!</b></p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="vel247" class="calibre3"></a>So far Petrosian had analysed everything during the intermission. He had seen that the black queen has to return to f6, where it is condemned to play a passive role, giving White free hand to finish off without risk.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">54…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>b2+ 55.<span class="chessfont">♔</span>g3 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>f6 56.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>d6+</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Petrosian’s play was always characterized by the motto ‘safety first’. Also possible was a liquidation to a queen ending with 56.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>d4 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>xd4 57.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xf7+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>d8 58.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>g8+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>e7 59.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>h7+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>e8 60.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xh6, which should be winning since White’s h-pawn has advanced quite far already.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">56…<span class="chessfont">♔</span>c8 57.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>d4</b></p>
<p class="noindent">The key to White’s winning plan. Black is forced to exchange queens, after which White’s bishop is superior to its black colleague.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">57…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>d8 58.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xd8+</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Finally he is allowed to liquidate to the ending he had in mind.</p>

<p class="noindent">White is a nice pawn up. But, even worse for Black: his pieces are bunched up and do not cooperate well. However, a winning position still has to be won. White’s last move was <span class="chessfont">♘</span>e5-c4, to defend the d5-pawn by a tactic. But it also contains a trap. Which one?</p>

<p class="noindent">It is clear that Black is wrestling with a lag in development, as a consequence of which a few of his pieces (<span class="chessfont">♖</span>a8 and, especially, <span class="chessfont">♗</span>c8) are still doing nothing. Which strategy should White pursue to take advantage of this lack in activity of his opponent?</p>

<p class="noindent">At first sight, Black seems to be fully in the game. However, White has a forced liquidation at his disposal, which yields him a virtually decisive endgame advantage. If you see which of the opponent’s pieces should be restricted, you will have little trouble finding the variation in its entirety.</p>
