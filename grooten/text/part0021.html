<p class="chap"><b class="calibre1">Chapter 16</b></p>
<p class="chap1"><b class="calibre1">Control of a rank</b></p>
<p class="level"><b class="calibre1">16.1 Introduction</b></p>
<p class="noindent">A player is inclined to play ‘bottom-up’, i.e. from his own side of the board, in the direction of his opponent. Because of this, the effect that pieces can have on a rank escapes our attention now and then. Imagine how many pieces have already been blundered by overlooking the horizontal activity of an enemy piece! See, for instance, the following opening trap: 1.e4 c5 2.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>f3 d6 3.c3 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>f6 4.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>e2 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>xe4?? 5.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>a4+.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="vel543" class="calibre3"></a>When I analysed games with the Dutch grandmaster Karel van der Weide, it struck me that I had trouble foreseeing ‘long’ queen moves like <span class="chessfont">♕</span>a4-g4 or <span class="chessfont">♕</span>b3-h3. For him, finding such moves was never a problem – he used to churn them out like nobody’s business.</p>
<p class="noindent1">In this chapter we look mainly at ways to involve our pieces in the game via a rank. In the following example we even see the white player using two ranks.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00497.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="noindent">White has a tremendous attacking position. With his next move he creates a mate threat with 2.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>h6.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">1.f6</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Black has only one defence.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">1…<span class="chessfont">♔</span>h8 2.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>h6 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>g8</b></p>
<p class="noindent">The first threat is warded off, but now White involves his rooks in the attack.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">3.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>f3!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Now the immediate threat is 4.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xh7+! followed by 5.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>h3#. This manoeuvre is called the ‘rook lift’: the rook is moved to a certain rank, on which it will join the attack.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">3…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xf3 4.gxf3</b></p>
<p class="noindent">But now it is the other rook that gets to play the starring role on the second rank. Again White threatens the queen sacrifice.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">4…d5</b></p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00498.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">5.f4!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">5.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>h2 would also have won, but the text move is the most accurate. White mustn’t be tempted to play 5.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xh7+?? in view of 5…<span class="chessfont">♔</span>xh7 6.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>h2+ <span class="chessfont">♕</span>xh2+.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">5…dxc4 6.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xh7+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>xh7 7.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>h2#</b></p>
<p class="noindent1"><a id="vel351" class="calibre3"></a>We have looked at the effect of a piece on one of our own ranks. Some of the opponent’s ranks, especially the seventh or eighth ones, can be objects of interest. From our experience, we know that the invasion of the enemy camp can be a strategic goal. In chapter 14, the relation between an open file and the seventh rank was discussed. In the present chapter I want to systematize a few aspects that are connected with the invasion of the seventh (or eighth) rank. Even though in this book the emphasis lies on strategy, in this case I cannot avoid bringing several frequently seen tactical tricks into the limelight.</p>
<p class="level"><b class="calibre1">16.2 Tactical tricks on the rank</b></p>
<p class="noindent">In most cases, a lot is happening on the seventh rank. In particular, two rooks on the seventh will often display devastating power. Aron Nimzowitsch already pointed this out a long time ago.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><b class="calibre1">• Winning a tempo</b></p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00499.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="noindent">This somewhat unnatural position was given in Nimzowitsch’s book <i class="calibre4">My System</i>. White is substantially behind in material and there is also a black pawn on the point of queening, but White disposes of a useful mechanism that guarantees him the win.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">1.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>h7+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>g8 2.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>fg7+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>f8</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Nimzowitsch indicates that the rooks should take up this starting position. Here, they are ready to maraud the entire seventh rank. From this position, White can gain tempi endlessly, thanks to a mate threat. The winning line goes as follows:</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">3.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xd7 <span class="chessfont">♔</span>g8</b></p>
<p class="noindent">The king must return in view of the mate threat.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">4.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>dg7+</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Again, the rooks take up their starting positions.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">4…<span class="chessfont">♔</span>f8 5.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xc7 <span class="chessfont">♔</span>g8 6.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>cg7+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>f8 7.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xb7 <span class="chessfont">♔</span>g8 8.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>bg7+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>f8 9.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xa7</b></p>
<p class="noindent">And once again Black must play</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">9…<span class="chessfont">♔</span>g8</b></p>
<p class="noindent">due to the mate threat, or play 9…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xa7. In either case the win is easy for White.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><b class="calibre1">• Mate patterns</b></p>
<p class="noindent">In the previous example, we saw the devastating power of two rooks on the seventh (or second) rank. But the harvest that can be gathered by them is not always so great. Sometimes there is nothing more to be gained than a perpetual check – unless help arrives from an unexpected quarter.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00500.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">1.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>h7+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>g8 2.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>fg7+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>f8</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Again, the rooks have first taken up the winning starting position from the previous diagram.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">3.h6!</b></p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="ch15level4" class="calibre3"></a>This pawn protects the <span class="chessfont">♖</span>g7, creating a mate threat that cannot be averted. It is important to have an h-pawn here, since there would be no win with a pawn on g6, as is easy to verify.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">3…a2 4.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>h8#</b></p>
<p class="noindent1"><b class="calibre1">• Violent entry</b></p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00501.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="noindent">Now and then some wood has to be chopped off so as to enable the other pieces to have a field day on the seventh rank.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">1.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xg7+!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">With this heavy sacrifice White forces a passage along the seventh rank.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">1…<span class="chessfont">♔</span>xg7 2.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>c7+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>g8 3.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xh7#</b></p>
<p class="noindent">By means of the rook sacrifice, White extended the seventh rank, destroying the protective layer around the black king. Then the second rook entered the black position, making the mate inevitable.</p>
<p class="noindent">We can see that the ‘slight’ pawn weakening …f7-f6 has made the seventh rank vulnerable. With the pawn on f7 there would be no problem for Black.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Such a swift action is characteristic for seventh-rank combinations. In almost all cases it is useful to combine your actions with a check. In the following diagram, Black has an extremely dangerous passed pawn, so White must be quick. He needs to harass the black king with a check.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00502.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">1.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>f1+</b></p>
<p class="noindent">White must think carefully on which square to give check. f2 would be wrong, since it would leave him without a good follow-up. Now everything comes with check.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">1…<span class="chessfont">♔</span>e8 2.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>b5+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>f8 3.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>b4+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>e8 4.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>e7#</b></p>
<p class="noindent1">I couldn’t leave out the next example, which belongs to the classics in chess history.</p>
<p class="game2t"><a id="ch16level1" class="calibre3"></a>Efim Geller</p>
<p class="game1"><a id="ch16level2" class="calibre3"></a>Max Euwe</p>
<p class="game2"><a id="ch16level3" class="calibre3"></a>Zurich ct 1953 (2)</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00503.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">1…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>h8!?</b></p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="vel323" class="calibre3"></a>Totally unexpectedly, Black takes over the initiative. By sacrificing a rook he diverts the white queen from the c2-square, so as to invade with his rook on the seventh rank. After long analyses with modern computer programs, the move turns out not to win by force objectively, but the courage needed to play such a move in a game, combined with the psychological effect of such a sacrifice, is a sign of brilliancy. We will see the consequences of the rook sacrifice in the following.</p>
<p class="noindent">Kasparov indicates that Black was already better and that he should have confirmed his advantage with 1…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>d5. After 2.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>e4 Kasparov claims that Black’s best continuation is 2…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>c4?!.</p>
<div class="breakinside">
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00504.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="caption">Analysis diagram</p>
</div>
<p class="noindent">However, the newest versions of the silicon monsters make mincemeat of this: after 3.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>g4!, the white attack is very strong.</p>
<p class="noindent">The engine suggests that the peculiar move 2…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>c6! keeps the advantage for Black. The idea is that, as yet, White cannot do anything with his <span class="chessfont">♖</span>e4, whereas Black can increase the pressure on the pinned piece with a possible …<span class="chessfont">♖</span>e6.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">2.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xh8</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Of course, Geller felt compelled to accept the sacrifice.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">2…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>c2</b></p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00505.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">3.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>c1?</b></p>
<p class="noindent">White is under the impression that he cannot defend against the strike on g2, so he desperately tries to arm himself against the lethal check on c4 that Black has weaved into the position. Only with the extremely hard-to-find 3.d5!! could White have disrupted the coordination between the black pieces:</p>
<p class="indentv">A) Various sources give 3…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>b6+ here, but after 4.<span class="chessfont">♔</span>h1 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>f2 5.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>g1 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>xd5 White has the beautiful point 6.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>e4!. After 6…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xe4 7.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xe4 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>h4, he will gain the upper hand with, for example, 8.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>d6+ (certainly not 8.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xg7?? <span class="chessfont">♕</span>xe4 9.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>f8+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>g6 10.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>h6 d5, and Black is clearly better) 8…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xd6 9.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xg7+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>e6 10.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>g8+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>e5.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00506.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="noindent">The round-up of the white king is in full swing, and with the elegant quiet moves 11.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>d1! <span class="chessfont">♕</span>e4 12.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>e3!! White gets a winning initiative. Such moves can hardly be found without the modern ‘silicon monsters’. Even present-day grandmasters are hardly able to see such tricks far in advance. 12…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xe3 13.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>d5+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>f4 14.g3+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>g4 15.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>d4+ is the fitting conclusion to this variation.</p>
<p class="indentv"><a id="ch15level8" class="calibre3"></a>B) 3…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xd5 4.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>d1! (the rook is much better on this square, since it keeps a close watch on the bishop on d5) 4…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xg2+ 5.<span class="chessfont">♔</span>f1 (here we see the difference with the game, where Euwe, with the bishop still on b7 and the white pawn on d4, dashes off a deadly attacking move) 5…gxh6 6.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xh6 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>f3! 7.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>d2, and a peaceful conclusion is on the cards.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">3…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xg2+ 4.<span class="chessfont">♔</span>f1</b></p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00507.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">4…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>b3!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">This is the original move with which Black crowns his counterattack. White does not have a defence against the invasion of the black pieces. The beautiful point is that the black queen supports the creation of a mating net from the third rank.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">5.<span class="chessfont">♔</span>e1</b></p>
<p class="noindent">5.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>f4 wouldn’t help either after 5…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>d3+ 6.<span class="chessfont">♔</span>e1 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>d2+ 7.<span class="chessfont">♔</span>f1 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>xc1#.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">5…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>f3</b></p>
<p class="noindent">And White resigned. 5…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>f3 6.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>f4 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>e3+ would lead to mate.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><b class="calibre1">• Draw by perpetual check</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Not everything in the garden of chess is lovely. Sometimes you have to look for counterchances in a bad or even a losing position. In such cases, it is logical to look if we can pose a threat to the enemy king in one way or another. A rook penetrating on the seventh rank, in combination with a knight on the sixth, may work wonders.</p>
<p class="noindent">A glance at the next diagram position teaches us that White is in great trouble.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00508.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="noindent">How on earth can he stop the maverick duo on b3 and a3? As it turns out, he can only save the half-point with the following contrivance:</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">1.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>d7!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">As will soon become apparent, this is the only good square for the rook. 1.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>f6 is less accurate, as Black then plays 1…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>d2 2.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>d7 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>f3+ 3.<span class="chessfont">♔</span>g2 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>g5, when he has managed to involve his knight in the defence with tempo.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">1…b2 2.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>f6 b1<span class="chessfont">♕</span> 3.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xh7+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>e8 4.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>f6+</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Besides giving checks, the knight also protects its own rook, giving the black king no chance to escape.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">4…<span class="chessfont">♔</span>f8 5.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>h7+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>g8 6.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>f6+</b></p>
<p class="noindent">And Black must settle for the perpetual, since after 6…<span class="chessfont">♔</span>h8 he will be mated.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">6…<span class="chessfont">♔</span>f8</b></p>
<p class="rights"><b class="calibre1">½-½</b></p>

<p class="image"><img src="../images/00509.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="vel575" class="calibre3"></a>Forsaken by all benevolent spirits, the talented black player produced the move</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">1…f1<span class="chessfont">♕</span>??</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Black could have won easily with 1…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>f3+!, chasing the white king to a square where the promotion is with check: 2.<span class="chessfont">♔</span>h3 f1<span class="chessfont">♕</span>+ and it is all over.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">2.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>f7+! <span class="chessfont">♔</span>g8</b></p>
<p class="noindent">More or less forced. 2…<span class="chessfont">♔</span>xe8 might be seen as a losing attempt after 3.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xf4+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>d7 4.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xf1.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">3.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>g7+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>f8</b></p>
<p class="noindent">3…<span class="chessfont">♔</span>h8 would not have helped either. It is again perpetual check after 4.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>h7+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>g8 5.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>g7+.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">4.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>f7+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>g8</b></p>
<p class="noindent">And, disappointed by the course of events, Black played on until the 64th move before finally conceding to a draw. Out of respect for what had happened, the white player refrained from claiming the half-point.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">5.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>g7+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>f8 6.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>f7+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>g8 7.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>g7+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>f8 8.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>f7+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>g8 9.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>g7+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>f8 10.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>f7+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>g8 11.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>g7+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>f8 12.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>f7+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>g8 13.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>g7+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>f8 14.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>f7+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>g8</b></p>
<p class="noindent">And the draw was agreed.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><b class="calibre1">• Springboard</b></p>
<p class="noindent">The notion of a ‘springboard’ has been discussed several times already in this book (see also Chapter 14). Here is another striking example of a useful foothold.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00510.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">1.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>h1+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>g8 2.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>h7+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>f8 3.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>h8+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>e7 4.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xc8</b></p>
<p class="rights"><b class="calibre1">1-0</b></p>
<p class="noindent">White wins the queen. White penetrated the enemy lines via the springboard on h7, playing the queen to the other side by what Nimzowitsch called ‘Umgehung’.</p>
<p class="level"><b class="calibre1">16.3 Strategic principles</b></p>
<p class="noindent">We have seen some interesting things that can take place on the second or seventh rank. Now it is time to formulate some rules with respect to open files, even though they have been discussed extensively in Chapter 14, which dealt with this subject. But we would like to know which files are important, and how we can discern them. In other words: which factors determine how we can penetrate the enemy regions? And the second question that needs to be answered is: ‘How do we know which file is important and which file isn’t?’.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><b class="calibre1">• Extension of the seventh rank by a weakening</b></p>
<p class="noindent">With the example of the violent entry by the rook, we already briefly signalled that weakening pawn moves can have far-reaching consequences.</p>
<p class="game2t"><a id="ch16level7" class="calibre3"></a>Wolfgang Unzicker</p>
<p class="game1"><a id="ch16level8" class="calibre3"></a>Robert Fischer</p>

<p class="image"><img src="../images/00511.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">1.g3?</b></p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="vel450" class="calibre3"></a>An ugly mistake, extending his second rank. Fischer does not have much trouble exploiting this weakening.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">1…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>a7! 2.<span class="chessfont">♔</span>g2 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>a2</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Here we see the consequences of the pawn move 1.g3. Not only 3…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xb2+ is threatened, but also 3…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xc3.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">3.<span class="chessfont">♔</span>f1</b></p>
<p class="noindent">After 3.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xa2 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>xa2, 4.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>e2 fails to 4…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xc3!.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00512.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">3…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xc3!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Again this move. Unzicker briefly looked at 4.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xa2 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>f3+ 5.<span class="chessfont">♔</span>e2 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>f2+ 6.<span class="chessfont">♔</span>d3 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>xa2 7.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>a1, but saw that he was lost after 7…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xb2, and therefore resigned.</p>

<p class="noindent">If we have penetrated on the seventh rank, this does not automatically yield us a full point. If one of our major pieces has come to pay a visit to the opponent, it will need assistance. How this support can be lent, and what power major pieces can have on the seventh rank, is attractively illustrated in the following fragment.</p>

<p class="noindent">White has obtained a decisive material advantage and converted this into a win in just a few more moves.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><b class="calibre1">• Seventh rank absolute</b></p>
<p class="noindent">The reader will not be surprised to hear that in many endgames the seventh rank is a factor of significance. Especially if the enemy king is cut off on the back rank, it may face several specific problems. In his treatment of rook endings, Nimzowitsch already drew our attention to this rule, which he called ‘the seventh rank absolute’. Below, we can see what he meant.</p>
<p class="image"><a id="vel451" class="calibre3"></a><img src="../images/00514.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="noindent">Materially speaking, Black is OK, and besides, he has a passed pawn on the second rank, supported by its own rook. But there are several other factors that cause him to lose nonetheless.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">1.e6!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">White forcefully breaks open the seventh rank.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">1…dxe6</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Black is obliged to take the pawn, as otherwise White’s far advanced connected passed pawns will force a quick decision.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">2.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xb7 <span class="chessfont">♔</span>c8</b></p>
<p class="noindent">After a rook move like 2…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>h3 3.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>b8+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>c7 4.f7, the pawn will queen.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">3.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xa7 <span class="chessfont">♔</span>b8 4.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>e7!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Not 4.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>g7?, since after 4…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>f8! 5.f7 the king will be able to leave the fatal back rank with 5…<span class="chessfont">♔</span>c7. After the text move White also threatens 6.f7, but at the same time he keeps the black king imprisoned on the bottom rank.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">4…<span class="chessfont">♔</span>c8 5.f7 <span class="chessfont">♔</span>d8</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Just in time, Black has managed to prevent the threat of 6.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>e8+, but since his king is cut off, he will not be able to avoid defeat.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">6.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>a7 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>f8</b></p>
<p class="noindent">The only move that does not lose a rook, but the positions that the black pieces have now been forced to take up are highly awkward.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00515.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">7.<span class="chessfont">♔</span>xh2</b></p>
<p class="noindent">And White wins easily. Black cannot move a finger and loses by zugzwang.</p>
<p class="level"><b class="calibre1">16.4 Supply routes along a rank</b></p>
<p class="noindent">If there is no possibility to force an entry on the seventh rank, we can avail of another method to penetrate the enemy regions. By moving up a little less far along a file with a rook, we aim for two things:</p>
<ul class="calibre8">
<li class="calibre7">we prepare a doubling;</li>
<li class="calibre7">we want to move to another file via this rank in order to force an entry in this way.</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">This is how we can succeed in arranging the supply of pieces via a rank. This is what Nimzowitsch called a ‘restricted advance’ on an open file. The idea is to advance the rook along a file in order to achieve some advantage on a certain rank.</p>
<p class="noindent">In the following schematic position we can see what his idea was.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00516.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="vel452" class="calibre3"></a>The purpose of an open file is to force an entry on the seventh rank (see also Chapter 14). In this schematic example this does not work on the f-file, but it will work in another way.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">1.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>f5</b></p>
<p class="noindent">White has set his sights on the b5-pawn, but he also aims to penetrate on the seventh rank via the b-file. With the text move he makes clever use of the f-file. Due to the pressure on f7, Black cannot free himself. The manoeuvre <span class="chessfont">♖</span>f1-f5xb5-b7 is instructive: the rook changes files after ‘selecting’ the rank that is the most interesting to do this on. Nimzowitsch himself has often applied this method in practice.</p>
<p class="game2t"><a id="ch16level13" class="calibre3"></a>Aron Nimzowitsch</p>
<p class="game1"><a id="ch16level14" class="calibre3"></a>Axel Pritzel</p>
<p class="game2"><a id="ch16level15" class="calibre3"></a>Copenhagen 1922 (4)</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00517.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="noindent">In this position White has built up heavy pressure on Black’s queenside. Moreover, he controls the only open file with his rooks. But for the moment he still cannot achieve very much with this, as Black is controlling all the important entry squares. With his next move White shuffles the cards.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">1.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>d3!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">On the d-file there is nothing to be gained for the rooks at the moment, so the rook moves up one step (the ‘restricted advance’), so it can be moved to the c-file along the third rank.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">1…bxa5?</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Black lends a helping hand. The passive defensive move 1…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>b8 would have given him better chances to save the game. Now that he has voluntarily taken his own pawn formation apart, he allows Nimzowitsch to bring his ‘restricted advance’ on the board.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">2.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>c3</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Also worthy of attention was 2.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>c5.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">2…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>e7 3.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>c5</b></p>
<p class="noindent">A second example of a ‘restricted advance’. By operating on the c-file, the rook can seek an advantage on the a-file via the fifth rank.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">3…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>fb8 4.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>ec3 a6</b></p>
<p class="noindent">The pawn on a7 could not be maintained in the long run, but now Black loses the b6-square.</p>

<p class="noindent1">Via a rank, a rook can give important support to an offensive against the enemy king. In the following fragment, White utilizes his rook via the third rank to support a hit-and-run attack.</p>

<p class="noindent">At the right moment, the seventh rank is forced open as well. Now the supremacy of White’s major pieces is more than Black can handle.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">15…fxg6 16.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>h7+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>f8 17.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xg6</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Black resigned. He will be mated.</p>
<p class="noindent1">It is even possible for a rook to participate in an attack from the fourth rank. Here is a magnificent example by Kasparov’s greatest rival – a game which Karpov ranked among his own favourites.</p>

<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">22.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>g4!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">In this position, the fourth rank is very useful for White – for defensive purposes as well as attacking ones.</p>
<p class="noindent">Black might now have considered taking on h2, since he will come under heavy fire anyway.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">22…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>f6 23.h4! <span class="chessfont">♕</span>f5 24.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>b4!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Preventing queenside castling, which at this moment would lose the queen after 25.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>g4.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">24…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>f6 25.h5 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>e7</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Not 25…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>e5? 26.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>f4!, and Black loses the bishop on f6!</p>

<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">27.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>f3!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Now the threat is 28.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>f4. The versatile rook is driving Black crazy!</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">27…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xd5 28.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>d3 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>xh6</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Playing for tricks: 29.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xh6 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>g5 and 30…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>e3+.</p>

<p class="noindent">Now comes the sixth, and decisive, rook switch:</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">30.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>d3! <span class="chessfont">♕</span>h1+ 31.<span class="chessfont">♔</span>c2 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>xa1 32.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xh6 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>e5 33.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>g5</b></p>
<p class="noindent">And in this hopeless position, Hort overstepped the time-limit.</p>

<p class="noindent">White has the ‘odious’ g-pawn, as was discussed in the study material of this chapter. So should he settle for a draw?</p>

<p class="noindent">The white queen has invaded the seventh rank via the only open file. However, Black has put up a solid barrier that appears hard to breach. How can White make progress?</p>

<p class="noindent">White is better thanks to his space advantage, but it is hard to see how he should make progress. He may sacrifice a pawn with <b class="calibre1">31.b5</b>. After <b class="calibre1">31…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xb5</b>, which piece would you use to take back? And what have you planned if you have invaded with your rook on c7 and you run into the reply <b class="calibre1">…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>c8</b> ?</p>

<p class="noindent">White’s pawn on e4 is hanging. Therefore he decides on 34.f3. It is clear that his second rank is now seriously weakened, and Black tries to exploit this. The follow-up was interesting: <b class="calibre1">34…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>a8 35.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>c4 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>a3 36.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>d1 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>c3 37.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>a4</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Now answer the following questions:</p>
<p class="noindent">a) What would Black play after 37.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xd4?</p>
<p class="noindent">b) What was Black’s strong continuation after the text move?</p>
