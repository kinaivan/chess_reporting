<p class="level"><b class="calibre1">19.1 Introduction</b></p>
<p class="noindent">In the decadent West, we are experiencing a penchant for Eastern culture at the moment. Developments are going so quickly that there is insufficient time for reflection. For this reason, more and more people are following meditative courses, like yoga.</p>
<p class="noindent">There is also a tendency to go in for combat sports. As for myself, I have never been able to put my mind to such things, but there is one Eastern combat sport that has a philosophy behind it that appeals to me: Tai Chi. I am told that with Tai Chi, the student is taught typical defensive techniques based on evasion. Tai Chi is all about your own inner balance. The Tai Chi master does not have to be strong, but keeps his balance in all situations, and forces the opponent to use all his power against himself. As he is in full harmony with himself, moving along with the opponent’s unexpected swings, the latter will hit nothing but air.</p>
<p class="noindent">The following remark of a Tai Chi master is significant: ‘I use only 10 pounds in order to receive 1000 pounds.’ By evading the blows in the nick of time, he causes the 1000 pounds to miss their target, and the opponent will get unbalanced rather than he.</p>
<p class="noindent">This phenomenon definitely applies to chess too. If you take care that everything is in harmony within your own ranks, nothing much can happen to you. Of course, a player must watch carefully which blows the opponent wants to strike ‘on the body’. By moving along with him and causing him to fight against himself, you need only ’10 pounds to receive 1000 pounds’.</p>
<p class="noindent">The following game is by the Dutch master Johan van Mil from Eindhoven, who sadly passed away in 2008 at the age of 49. With him I travelled through Europe for several years, in search of adventure and eternal fame. From a young age, Van Mil suffered from kidney problems. When he finally underwent a transplant, he was afraid of one day unexpectedly receiving a blow on this new kidney. This fear caused him to take up Tai Chi, with which, as he said, he also achieved a better inner balance. In the following magnificently played game, he applies the art of evasion to perfection:</p>

<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">20…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>b7!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">The first signs of the Tai Chi strategy. With 20…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xb2?! Black would agree to engage in the fist fight that White has in mind. After 21.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>b1 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>c4 22.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xc6 dxc6 23.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xb4 Black hasn’t exactly made much progress.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">21.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>c1 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>c8</b></p>
<p class="noindent">21…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xb2 22.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>b1 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>a4 23.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xb4 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>c5 gives White reasonable counterplay – he will even have a slight edge.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">22.b3</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Now, after 22.c3, Black could capture on b2: 22…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xb2! 23.cxb4 <span class="chessfont">♔</span>e7, and the nasty threat is 24…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>d3.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">22…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>d6 23.f3 <span class="chessfont">♔</span>e7 24.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>e2</b></p>
<p class="noindent">White has to try to solve his pawn weakness on c2 as soon as possible, otherwise Black will double his rooks on the c-file.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">24…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>b5 25.c4 bxc3 26.a4 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>a7!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">The knight will be eyeing the c6-square after a while, from where it could make use of the weakness that has just been created on b4.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">27.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xc3 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>c6 28.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>a2 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>hc8</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Threatening 29…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>c2.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">29.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xc6 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>xc6 30.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>c1</b></p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00585.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">30…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>d6!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Black avoids the rook swap, since in the following his rook will have more influence than his opponent’s.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">31.h4?!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Weakening his pawn formation, which will cost him dearly later on.</p>
<p class="noindent">Admittedly, 31.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>c7 was not possible in view of 31…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>d1+ 32.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>f1 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>xf1+ 33.<span class="chessfont">♔</span>g2 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>a1, but it would have been better to continue 31.<span class="chessfont">♔</span>g1.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">31…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>c6 32.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>c3 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>d2 33.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>c1 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>d4</b></p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00586.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="noindent">The knight opts for the central square d4, and thus Black is ready for …f6-f5.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">34.b4?!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">This more or less leads to the loss of a pawn, but White hopes that he will be able to hold a draw in the position with four pawns versus five on the same wing.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">34…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>c6 35.b5</b></p>
<p class="noindent">In his distress, White gives a pawn, as he is afraid that Black will later emerge with an outside passed pawn.</p>
<p class="noindent">The continuation 35.a5 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>b5 looks bad for White, since the threat of 36…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>b2, winning a pawn, cannot be averted, and the weak a-pawn will soon be lost as well.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">35…axb5 36.axb5 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>xb5 37.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>d3 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>b2</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Once again, Black avoids the rook swap. His pieces are arranged harmoniously, whereas any cohesion between the white pieces is lacking.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">38.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>b3</b></p>
<p class="noindent">White intends at least to land a blow below the belt with 39.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>d4.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">38…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>d6</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Once again, Black avoids all confrontations.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">39.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>d4 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>b7 40.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>b3 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>d2 41.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>b5</b></p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00587.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">41…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>f7!</b></p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="vel551" class="calibre3"></a>Meticulously, every piece exchange is avoided. Thus Black shows that he has fully mastered the ‘art of evasion’. In his comments to this game Van Mil wrote: ‘The white knight would have been best placed beside the board now; there is no function for it to be found anywhere.’</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">42.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>c3 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>c6 43.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>b1</b></p>
<p class="noindent">It is amusing to see White’s pieces continuously hitting thin air. The black position doesn’t offer a single target.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">43…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>e5 44.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>d1 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>c2 45.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>b1</b></p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00588.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">45…f5!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Now that he has sent the opponent’s 1000 pounds in the wrong direction, Black takes action. With the text move, he initiates the first ‘physical’ contact for ages. And he hits home immediately. A true Tai Chi master might have opted for 45…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>c4 here, creating the threat of 46…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xg2! in the process.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">46.<span class="chessfont">♔</span>g1</b></p>
<p class="noindent">46.exf5? was out of the question, on account of 46…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xg2 47.<span class="chessfont">♔</span>xg2 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>xf3+, and Black wins a piece.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">46…fxe4 47.fxe4 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>g4</b></p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="vel554" class="calibre3"></a>Threatening 48…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xg2+ followed by 49…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>e3+. Rarely will grandmaster Vogt have felt so powerless in a game.</p>
<p class="noindent">More in style was 47…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>c4, since here the knight is invulnerable, and, besides threatening 48…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xg2, it also deprives the white knight of its most important squares.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">48.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>e1?!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">This leads to a quiet demise. White could still try 48.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>f3 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>e3 49.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>d3 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>c1+ 50.<span class="chessfont">♔</span>f2 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>c4 51.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>d2, when at least his pieces would be brought back to life.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">48…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>f6 49.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>a3 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>c3</b></p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00589.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="noindent">After a knight move, a second pawn will be lost, and more losses will follow soon. The white player didn’t feel like waiting for this and resigned.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Now we are talking about harmony, it is important to recognize when the harmony within your own lines has been disturbed. This may be caused by a number of reasons:</p>
<p class="indent1v"><b class="calibre1">A) The pieces are in each other’s way</b></p>
<p class="indentv"><b class="calibre1">A1) Due to lack of space, some of the pieces are hindered in their manoeuvres</b></p>
<p class="noindent">We have seen clear examples of this elsewhere in this book.</p>
<p class="indent1v"><b class="calibre1">A2) Two pieces want to make use of the same square</b></p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="vel463" class="calibre3"></a>This principle is explained by the Romanian grandmaster Mihai Suba in his book <i class="calibre4">Dynamic Chess Strategy</i>:</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="level1"><b class="calibre1">Clearing Policy</b></p>
<p class="noindent">The position must be cleared of strategic and tactical impurities in order to obtain a clear and realizable strategic advantage. It should go without saying that in all themes, what is good for one side is bad for the other. As a corollary of the ‘clearing policy’ we can infer the need to refrain from ‘clearing’ when the opponent has an obvious strategic advantage, in order to avoid leaving it as the main factor in the position. In a Soviet magazine I once saw an interesting article entitled ‘Lishnaya Figura’ (= roughly ‘The Superfluous Piece’). It stressed the inactivity of the superfluous piece, which may cause trouble for its owner. Here is an example:</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00590.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="noindent">White to move should play</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">1.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xc7 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>xc7 2.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>d5</b></p>
<p class="noindent">with a clear advantage of a dominant knight against a bad bishop and automatic play on the queenside by b4, bxc5 etc. Black to move should avoid the exchange and make the knight on c3 superfluous, e.g. <b class="calibre1">1…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>e6</b>, keeping the game alive with good counterchances on the kingside.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent1v"><b class="calibre1">A3) Due to specific circumstances, development has been disturbed considerably, and it is hard to complete it</b> (see the game Botvinnik-Yudovich)</p>
<p class="indent1v"><b class="calibre1">B) The cooperation between the pieces has been disturbed</b></p>
<p class="indentv"><b class="calibre1"><a id="ch19inlevel2" class="calibre3"></a>B1) Due to the activity of the enemy pieces, one’s own pieces are ‘wrong-footed’</b> (see the game O’Kelly de Galway-Castaldi)</p>
<p class="indentv"><b class="calibre1"><a id="vel208" class="calibre3"></a>B2) A certain piece can do nothing due to the pawn structure</b> (see the game Nimzowitsch-Rubinstein)</p>
<p class="indentv"><a id="vel552" class="calibre3"></a><b class="calibre1">B3) Pieces are hitting thin air, lacking targets</b> (see the game Vogt-Van Mil given earlier)</p>
<p class="indentv"><a id="ch19inlevel3" class="calibre3"></a><b class="calibre1">B4) A certain piece is inconveniently in the way, disturbing the harmony between the queen- and the kingside</b> (see the game M.Gurevich-Timman)</p>
<p class="noindent1">It’s high time to discuss the above-mentioned games.</p>
<p class="game">SL 3.6 (D96)</p>
<p class="game1"><a id="ch19level4" class="calibre3"></a>Mikhail Botvinnik</p>
<p class="game1"><a id="ch19level5" class="calibre3"></a>Mikhail Yudovich</p>
<p class="game2"><a id="ch19level6" class="calibre3"></a>Leningrad ch-URS 1933</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">1.c4 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>f6 2.d4 g6 3.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>c3 d5 4.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>f3 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>g7 5.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>b3 c6 6.cxd5 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>xd5 7.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>d2 0-0 8.e4</b></p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00591.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">8…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>b6?!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">This is the root of all the evil that will befall Black later in the game. He should have preferred the exchange on c3.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">9.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>d1 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>8d7 10.a4! a5</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Thus Black weakens the b6-square, adding to his strategic problems.</p>
<p class="noindent">He had a chance to become active, but then he would have had to sacrifice an exchange after 10…e5 11.dxe5 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>xe5 12.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xe5 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>xe5 13.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>h6 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>e7 14.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xf8 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>xf8 – which, incidentally, would certainly have given him compensation.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">11.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>e3</b></p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00592.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="noindent">In this position, Black faces a problem that we can compare to the famous cutting of the Gordian knot. In order to develop his queenside, Black has to involve his c8-bishop in the game. To achieve this, he will have to reposition his d7-knight, but there are enormous disadvantages attached to this. For instance, 11…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>f6 is strongly met by 12.d5!, and after 12…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>bd7 13.dxc6 bxc6 Black is left with a terrible weakness on c6, for which he hardly has any dynamic compensation.</p>
<p class="noindent">So the knight cannot leave d7, as that will leave its colleague on b6 unprotected. Let’s put it like this: if Black wants to remove his d7-knight, he will first have to do something about the b6-knight. But, as is easy to establish, the b6-knight has no squares available to it. A set-up with …<span class="chessfont">♖</span>b8 followed by …<span class="chessfont">♘</span>a8 does not provide a solution either, since then White would have <span class="chessfont">♗</span>e3-f4, apart from the fact that on a8, the knight is not exactly beautifully placed either.</p>
<p class="noindent">So everything is connected. The problem of the b6-knight cannot be solved until White no longer has the possibility of d4-d5. Black cannot move a piece before he has done something about this.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="vel604" class="calibre3"></a>Yudovich conceived the plan to relieve the pressure on his position by driving away the white queen from b3 with the manoeuvre …<span class="chessfont">♕</span>d8-c7-d6-b4.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">11…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>c7 12.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>e2 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>d6 13.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>a2!</b></p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="vels11" class="calibre3"></a>Botvinnik keeps his grip on the opponent, and doesn’t allow him to untie himself with 13…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>b4+. The misplacing of the white knight is only a temporary problem.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">13…e6</b></p>
<p class="noindent">As long as White has a set-up with <span class="chessfont">♕</span>b3 and <span class="chessfont">♗</span>e3, there is hardly anything sensible to be found for Black.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">14.0-0 h6 15.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>c1!</b></p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00593.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="noindent">White prepares the development of the king’s rook to d1.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">15…f5</b></p>
<p class="noindent">The black player wants to drive away the bishop on e3 by force, and he also hopes to get hold of the d5-square, after which he could nurse some hopes of cutting the Gordian knot.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">16.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>c3</b></p>
<p class="noindent">A good moment to bring the misplaced knight back into the game.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">16…<span class="chessfont">♔</span>h7</b></p>
<p class="noindent">The black king leaves the vulnerable a2-g8 diagonal, allowing Black the possibility of working with …<span class="chessfont">♕</span>d6-b4.</p>
<p class="noindent">Incidentally, 16…fxe4 would offer no relief either after 17.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xe4, and now:</p>
<p class="indentv">A) 17…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>e7. The best defence, after which White does best to continue with 18.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>e5!, still dictating the game;</p>
<p class="indentv">B) Provocative, but less good is 17…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>d5 18.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>c2!, and now:</p>

<p class="caption">Analysis diagram</p>
</div>
<p class="indentv">B1) 18…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>f7, intending 19…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>f8, fails to 19.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>c3, winning the g6-pawn;</p>
<p class="indentv">B2) 18…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>f6 19.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>c3, and again the pawn g6 disappears from the board, with grave consequences;</p>
<p class="indentv">B3) The violent attempt 18…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xa4 does not offer any relief after 19.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>c4 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>f5 20.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>h4 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>h5 21.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xe6+, and White has a lethal initiative.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">17.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>fd1 fxe4?</b></p>
<p class="noindent">After this, Black will no longer be able to involve his pieces in the game. In the meantime, he has opened the centre for his opponent, and as a result his king falls prey to the combined powers of the white pieces.</p>
<p class="noindent">Black should now have continued consistently with 17…f4!. Then, after 18.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>d2, 18…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>b4 looks like a nice try for Black.</p>
<p class="indentv">A) Not advisable for White is 19.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xb4?! axb4 20.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>b1 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>xa4 21.b3 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>a2 22.<span class="chessfont">♔</span>f1, followed by 23.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xb4, and White has the better endgame, but this is not yet disastrous for Black;</p>
<p class="indentv">B) 19.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xe6?! <span class="chessfont">♘</span>e5! 20.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>a2 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>xf3+ 21.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xf3 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>xd4 is still playable for Black;</p>
<p class="indentv">C) The correct reaction is 19.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>c2!, threatening a discovered attack by the knight. If Black prevents this with, for example, 19…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>e7, then White continues with the strong 20.e5, after which the weakness of the g6-pawn will be Black’s downfall.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">18.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xe4 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>b4 19.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>c2!</b></p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="vels12" class="calibre3"></a>Botvinnik directs his attention to the weak point g6 and does not indulge in the e6-pawn with 19.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xe6?!, since this would only be of service to his opponent after 19…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>f6. At the cost of a pawn, Black would have managed to bring his pieces into play.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">19…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xa4 20.b3 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>a3 21.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>h4!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">A new attack on the g6-pawn, which now comes under heavy fire.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">21…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>e7</b></p>
<p class="noindent">This does not parry the threat, but there was no longer anything sensible to be found. After, for instance, 21…a4 22.bxa4 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>xa4 23.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>d3 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>d5, White again deals the decisive blow with 24.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xg6!, as will happen in the game.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00595.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">22.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xg6!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">The inevitable combination that had been hanging in the air for a while.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">22…<span class="chessfont">♔</span>xg6 23.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>h5+!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">This magnet attack constitutes the final blow.

Therefore, Black resigned.</p>
<p class="noindent">When playing through games by good grandmasters it strikes me that they almost invariably set up their pieces in an optimal way. This is not so easy, for how can you make your pieces cooperate? In many cases, what counts is to establish which pieces are not active, and how they can be given a brighter future. And, as a rule, this is closely connected with the pawn structure. The following example is a good illustration.</p>
<p class="game2t"><a id="ch19level7" class="calibre3"></a>Aron Nimzowitsch</p>
<p class="game1"><a id="ch19level8" class="calibre3"></a>Akiba Rubinstein</p>
<p class="game2"><a id="ch19level9" class="calibre3"></a>Dresden 1926 (5)</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00596.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="noindent">Most of the white pieces are active, or will soon become active. White has just opened the e-file to increase the activity of his pieces. Now White hopes to make use of the weakness of the e6-square. How should he go about this?</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">18.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>h1!!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">This move is based on a brilliant concept. Nimzowitsch has discovered that his knight is not well placed, and manoeuvres it to squares where it will have a better future. Via h1-f2-h3-g5, the knight will be involved in a dangerous attack on the black king.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">18…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>d7 19.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>f2 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>ae8 20.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>fe1 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>xe2 21.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xe2 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>d8</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Not 21…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>e8 22.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xe8+ <span class="chessfont">♗</span>xe8 23.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>d5 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>e7 24.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xd4, and White has won a valuable pawn.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">22.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>h3 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>c6</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Black cannot keep the white knight out with 22…h6, because 23.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>g5! would follow anyway. After 23…hxg5?? it is mate with 24.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>h5.</p>

<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">25.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>f2!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">White is combining several ideas. The attack on d4 is unpleasant for Black.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">25…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>c5</b></p>
<p class="noindent">25…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>b6 was no solution either, as White would have the tricky 26.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>e1!. If Black would then help himself to the b2-pawn, he would catch a cold: 26…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xb2 27.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>a5 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>a3 28.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>b6 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>c5 29.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xc5 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>xc5 30.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>e7+, and the white attack is decisive.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">26.b4</b></p>
<p class="noindent">This was the intention of White’s previous move. The bishop now has to change diagonals, which makes the e7-square vulnerable.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">26…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>b6?</b></p>
<p class="noindent">The pawn loss after 26…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>e7 27.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xd4+ <span class="chessfont">♗</span>f6 would still have been the lesser of two evils. With the text move, the black player could have tripped up badly.</p>

<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">27.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>h4?</b></p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="vel210" class="calibre3"></a>Remarkably enough, Nimzowitsch does not seize this sudden chance.</p>
<p class="noindent">With the subtle 27.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>e1!, he could have secured the point. The penetration of the rook on e7 is devastating, for example: 27…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>d6 28.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>e7+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>h8 29.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>g5.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">27…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>e8!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">In this way, Black remains on his feet.</p>

<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">28.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>e5!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Black has defended craftily, but now he faces great problems again.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">28…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>f7?!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">An ugly inaccuracy, just when the black player seemed to have matters in hand again.</p>

<p class="noindent">After 28…h6, White can take aim at the weakened king’s position with 29.g4!?. Now, 29…fxg4? is immediately losing, in view of the pretty surprise attack 30.f5! h5 (or 30…g5 31.f6+! and the black position collapses like a house of cards)</p>

<p class="noindent">It is amusing to see how from this diagonal (e1-h4), the queen has already caused quite a stir in the black camp. With the text move, the disorientation of the black pieces is exposed. Black cannot prevent the invasion via e5 or e7.</p>

By sending the knight around the block and putting it on e6, White definitively ties up the mating net around the black king. Incidentally, the combinative idea that the white player is envisaging is also worth seeing.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">34…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>g7</b></p>
<p class="noindent">A pity. Black decides to give a piece in order not to be mated, but this won’t save the game. He would have done better to grant his opponent the honour to finish his beautiful masterpiece in style:</p>
<p class="indentv">A) 34…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xb5 costs a piece after 35.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>f6+ <span class="chessfont">♕</span>g7 36.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xb6;</p>

<p class="noindent">And, much too late, Black resigned.</p>
<p class="noindent1">In the following game Black comes a cropper because his pieces are wrong-footed.</p>
<p class="game2t"><a id="ch19level10" class="calibre3"></a>Alberic O’Kelly de Galway</p>

<p class="image"><img src="../images/00603.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="noindent">At first sight this position seems OK for Black. White is suffering from an isolated pawn that can be blockaded with …<span class="chessfont">♘</span>b6-d5. What does stand out is the great activity of the white rooks.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">19…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>c8?</b></p>
<p class="noindent">With one blow, this move changes the position from quite playable to very hard to handle for Black. The correct path was 19…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>d7, even though White would also have the better prospects after 20.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>c5!.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">20.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>c5!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">With this queen move White steps up the pressure, and now he is ready for 21.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>g5.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00604.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">20…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>d6?</b></p>
<p class="noindent">But this is a really serious mistake. Slowly Black’s pieces are ending up on the wrong squares.</p>
<p class="noindent">Better was 20…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>d5, with the possible continuation 21.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xd5 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>xd5 22.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>a3 (on 22.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xa7, 22…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>g4! is strong) 22…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>g4 23.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xb7 (23.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>e5 is no better in view of 23…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>c8!, and 23.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>e8 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>d6 is also completely equal) 23…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xf3 24.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xf3 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>xf3 25.gxf3 a5, and probably Black will be able to keep the game within drawing margins.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">21.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>a5</b></p>
<p class="noindent">The immediate 21.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>g5 also definitely deserved attention.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">21…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>b8?</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Much too passive.

<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">22.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>g5!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Now that the black pieces are tucked away on the queenside, White comes up with this queen switch to the kingside.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">22…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>d5</b></p>
<p class="noindent">In desperation, Black closes off the a2-g8 diagonal. The consequences of 22…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>d6 23.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>h6 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>f6 24.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>g5 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>g7 25.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xf7 would also have been disastrous for him.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">23.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>h6</b></p>
<p class="rights"><b class="calibre1">1-0</b></p>
<p class="noindent">There is nothing to be found against the threat of 24.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>g5. In this game the black player went astray because he neglected the cooperation between his pieces. Consequently, several pieces became passive, whereas all of the white player’s pieces became active. This surplus in activity resulted in an unstoppable attack on the king.</p>
<p class="noindent1">In the following game, one single piece is very much in the way of its own colleagues. As a result, the black player is greatly hampered in his manoeuvres. This leads to disharmony in his position, which the white player manages to exploit admirably.</p>

<p class="noindent"><a id="vel500" class="calibre3"></a>Timman must have regretted this later. The knight should not go to this square, since it seriously disturbs the harmonious set-up of the black pieces. As we will see, the knight will still be standing here at the end of the game. Better was 10…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>b8, although also here Black has not solved his opening problems yet.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">11.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>g2 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>g4?</b></p>
<p class="noindent">It would have been better to create some kind of future for his knight on d8. For that purpose, Black should probably have moved his king’s knight, intending to prepare 12…f5 or 12…f6, vacating the f7-square for the unfortunate queen’s knight. After the game, the players looked at two interesting possibilities, which prove that the position is not so bad for Black:</p>
<p class="indentv">A) 11…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>g4!? 12.h3 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>h6 13.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>d2 f5 14.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xh6 gxh6 15.e3 f4, with counterplay;</p>

<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">12.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>h4!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">A strong move by the Russo-Belgian chess player from Turkey. White is eyeing the f5-square, and at the same time gets ready for the push f2-f4.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">12…c6 13.0-0 cxd5 14.cxd5 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>d7</b></p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00607.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="noindent">By the exchange of the light-squared bishops, Black wants to bring some relief to his cramped position, but he has reckoned without his opponent.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">15.f4!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Now that the black pieces are unfortunately placed, White considers that it is time to act. He is threatening 16.fxe5, or, possibly, to lock in the black bishop with 16.h3 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>h5 17.g4, followed by 18.f5.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">15…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>b5 16.e4</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Much stronger than 16.fxe5?, which after 16…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xd5 is playable for Black.</p>
<p class="noindent">Perhaps 16.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>d2 was even to be preferred. After 16…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xe2 17.fxe5 dxe5 18.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>fe1, White’s chances should be rated highly.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">16…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>e2</b></p>
<p class="noindent">A dubious plan, which meets with an energetic counter by White. However, it is not easy to suggest a worthy alternative for Black.</p>
<p class="noindent">For instance, after 16…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>d7 17.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>ae1 f6 18.h3 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>h5 19.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>f5 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>b6+ 20.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>f2, Black also lands in virtually insurmountable trouble. In order to protect the weakness on d6, he has to play 20…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>f7, but this, in turn, will cause trouble for his bishop on h5. This illustrates how badly the black pieces are standing in each other’s way. One illustrative variation: 20…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>f7 21.g4 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>g6 22.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>e7+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>h8 23.f5, leading to a lost position for Black.</p>

<p class="noindent"><a id="ch19inlevel4" class="calibre3"></a>Gurevich is not to be tempted into interesting sacrificial play, but directs his fire at the vulnerability of the black bishop. In the tournament book, IM Cor van Wijgerden, who had commented on the game for the spectators, gives the following spectacular line that they had found together: 17.fxe5, and now:</p>
<p class="indentv">A) 17…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xf1 18.exf6 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>xg2 19.fxg7 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>e8 20.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>f5;</p>

<p class="indentv">C) Van Wijgerden himself remarks that unfortunately, 17…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>g4!? puts a spanner in the works. However, closer investigation shows that White can obtain an advantage then too, with 18.exd6 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>xf1 19.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xf1 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>c5+ 20.<span class="chessfont">♔</span>h1, and the white pieces are cooperating excellently;</p>
<p class="indentv">D) 17…dxe5 18.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xf6 gxf6 19.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>f5, and White has a strong attack.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">17…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>d3 18.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>d2 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>e8</b></p>
<p class="noindent">The move 18…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>g4 looks like a nice try for Black to take control, but after the measured reply 19.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>f3! h5 20.h3 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>f6, the knight must return empty-handed, and Black has got himself into an even tighter spot.</p>
<p class="noindent">Neither does 18…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>c4 offer a solution. Here, 19.b3! is absolutely the best continuation. After 19…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>a6 20.fxe5 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>g4 21.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>f5, Black no longer has any say in the proceedings, either.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">19.<span class="chessfont">♔</span>h1</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Useful prophylaxis, after which Black finds himself in big trouble. His bishop on d3 is ‘hanging in the air’ and he also has to reckon with the threat of 20.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>f5, after which the pawn on d6 cannot be protected anymore (20…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>a6 21.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xd6! <span class="chessfont">♕</span>xd6 22.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xd3).

<p class="noindent">In the tournament book, Van Wijgerden indicates that the immediate 19.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>f5, with the double threat of 20.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xd6 and 20.fxe5, would also have been strong.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">19…g6</b></p>
<p class="noindent">It is hard to suggest something sensible for Black, but with the text move he jumps from the frying-pan into the fire. The knight must be kept from f5, but the remedy is worse than the disease. The weakening of the dark squares on the kingside has unpleasant consequences for Black, as will become clear shortly.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">20.a4 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>a6 21.b3!</b></p>

<p class="noindent">Black would then have had to go into swindle mode with 22…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>g4, which leads to the following variations:</p>
<p class="indentv">A) 23.h3? <span class="chessfont">♖</span>xc3! 24.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xc3 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>f2+ 25.<span class="chessfont">♔</span>h2 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>xd1 26.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xd1 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>xe4 27.fxe5 (certainly not 27.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xe4? <span class="chessfont">♕</span>e2+, and Black has the last laugh) 27…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xe5, and Black can finally breathe a sigh of relief.</p>
<p class="indentv">B) However, 23.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>c1! is a good reply, as is shown by:</p>
<p class="indentv">B1) 23…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>b6? fails to 24.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>f3! <span class="chessfont">♘</span>f2+ 25.<span class="chessfont">♔</span>g2, and the black pieces have become entangled;</p>
<p class="indentv">B2) 23…exf4 24.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xf4 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>e5, but here also, White’s position is preferable after 25.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>f6;</p>
<p class="indentv">B3) 23…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>f6, and now 24.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>e3 is again met by 24…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>g4, but 24.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>f3 is very strong. White is simply threatening 25.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>cd1, after which the bishop on d3 is lost.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">22…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>d7 23.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>ad1 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>c5</b></p>
<p class="noindent">The only way temporarily to save the bishop, but it won’t help.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">24.fxe5</b></p>
<p class="noindent">The beginning of the end. The black position will soon collapse.</p>
<p class="noindent">By the way, the text move is better than 24.b4?, which fails to 24…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xa4.</p>
<p class="noindent">White had another good possibility in 24.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>e3, after which Black does not have the miraculous escape he has been planning with 24…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>f1, as after 25.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>e1! <span class="chessfont">♗</span>d3 26.fxe5 dxe5 27.b4, the curtain also falls.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">24…b5</b></p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="vel570" class="calibre3"></a>Panic. Taking back on e5 is not on for Black. After 24…dxe5 25.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>b4!, White wins a piece. For example, 25…f5 26.exf5! (a killer. Also after 26.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xc5 fxe4 27.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>a3 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>c2 28.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>e3 exf3 29.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xd3 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>xd3 30.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xd3 f2 31.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>f1, White wins. ‘In all these lines, the cheerless position of the black knight stands out’, Van Wijgerden adds superfluously) 26…e4 27.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>e3 b6 28.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xc5 bxc5 29.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xd3.</p>

<p class="noindent">Black resigned, since after he loses a piece he has nothing left to hope for.</p>
<p class="noindent1">In the following game, after a quiet start, suddenly all hell breaks loose. Alekhine’s imaginative power produces a jewel of a combination.</p>

<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">28.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>d1</b></p>
<p class="noindent">In the preceding phase White has had little to say, and so any harmony between his pieces is hard to find. With his next move Alekhine starts a combination that is unequalled in its kind.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">28…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>d3!!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">An introduction to a brilliant concept.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">29.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xa5 b4 30.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xa8</b></p>
<p class="noindent">After 30.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>a1 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>xa5 31.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xa5 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>a8! 32.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xc7 (even worse is 32.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xa8 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>xa8 33.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>b3 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>a3, and Black’s b-pawn cannot be stopped) 32…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>a1, the black queen wreaks havoc in the white position.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">30…bxc3</b></p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="ch19inlevel1" class="calibre3"></a>Alekhine’s imaginative vision is astonishing. It is really a pity that with the perfunctory 30…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xa8 31.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>b3 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>a1, another winning position could have been reached, since here also, none of the white pieces are functioning well.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">31.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xe8</b></p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00612.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">31…c2!!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">The extraordinarily surprising point of the combination. In exchange for two rooks, Black promotes to a new queen, which will leave a trail of destruction in the disorientated white camp.</p>
<p class="noindent">After 31…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xe8?, all would have been for nothing. With 32.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xc3, White escapes by his skin of his teeth.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">32.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xf8+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>h7 33.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>f2 c1<span class="chessfont">♕</span>+ 34.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>f1 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>e1!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">As a rule, a queen and a knight cooperate excellently in the attack. As before, we can see that there is a total lack of coordination between the white pieces.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">35.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>h2 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>xc4</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Apart from capturing a pawn, Black brings a new piece into play. The threat of 36…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>b5 becomes acute.</p>
<p class="noindent">Also definitely worthy of consideration was 35…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>c2, after which the pawn on e3 is doomed.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">36.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>b8</b></p>
<p class="noindent">White has no satisfactory solution to the above-mentioned threat. For example, after 36.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>d1 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>b5 37.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>f2 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>g4 he will also have a decisive material disadvantage.</p>

<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">41.d5</b></p>
<p class="noindent">White cannot move a single piece for fear of losing the crucial e3-pawn.</p>
<p class="noindent">41.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>g3 is met by 41…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xe3, and 41.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>h3 loses to 41…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>g4.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">41…<span class="chessfont">♔</span>g8</b></p>
<p class="noindent">With this ‘macho move’, Alekhine underlines Black’s helplessness. It is amusing to see how Black holds the position in his grip. The white pieces can hardly move.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">42.h5 <span class="chessfont">♔</span>h7!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Slightly sadistically, Black waits until White runs out of pawn moves and then strikes home. The white player could have spared himself the following slaughter.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">43.e4 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>xe4 44.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xe4 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>xe4 45.d6 cxd6 46.f6 gxf6 47.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>d2 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>e2</b></p>
