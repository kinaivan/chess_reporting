<p class="chap"><b class="calibre1">Chapter 14</b></p>
<p class="chap1"><b class="calibre1">The open file</b></p>
<p class="level"><b class="calibre1">14.1 Introduction</b></p>
<p class="noindent">It is not surprising that open files play an important role in chess games. In order to pose threats to the opponent we would like to enter his position with our pieces. An open file always has a connection with a certain rank. Especially the ranks on enemy territory are of paramount importance. That is why in Chapter 16 we will look at the sixth, seventh and eighth rank, to see what can be gained if our pieces have invaded there. It is almost superfluous to observe that the patterns that are valid for open diagonals and ranks, also apply to open files. The diagonal we have discussed in the chapter on the bishop. With the open file it is logical to discuss the rook separately, since the characteristics of the rook are essentially different from those of the bishop. Whereas a bishop can only reach half of the squares, a rook can go anywhere.</p>
<p class="noindent">Otherwise, just like the bishop, the rook may be hindered by obstacles in front of it, and it works well on an open file. Another point is that the bishop often supports certain actions from a distance, whereas the rook fulfils a more active role. An important given is that as soon as the rook has conquered a file, it very much wants to move forward and penetrate the enemy lines.</p>
<p class="noindent">In the next sections we will look at the following aspects:</p>
<p class="level"><b class="calibre1">14.2 Conquering an open file<br class="calibre2"/> 14.3 Undermining an obstacle<br class="calibre2"/> 14.4 Exploiting an open file<br class="calibre2"/> 14.2 Conquering an open file</b></p>
<p class="noindent">If a white and a black rook are on the same open file, a field of tension is created between both rooks. This field of tension can be quickly neutralized if all the major pieces are exchanged on this file. Then the open file is no longer of interest.</p>
<p class="noindent">It is more interesting if a struggle breaks out where both players dispute the presence of each other’s rooks on the file. In practice, we have various methods to conquer a file. I shall restrict myself to giving one typical diagram per method. Below is the scheme containing the different battle methods:</p>
<p class="indent1v"><b class="calibre1">A) The file is open</b></p>
<p class="indentv"><b class="calibre1">A1) Driving away the defenders</b></p>
<p class="indentv"><b class="calibre1">A2) Making use of a foothold</b></p>
<p class="indentv"><b class="calibre1">A3) Temporarily closing off a file by a piece of your own, with the intention to double (or triple) behind it</b></p>
<p class="indent1v"><b class="calibre1">B) The file is (as yet) closed</b></p>
<p class="indentv"><b class="calibre1">B1) Doubling (or tripling) and then threatening to open the file</b></p>
<p class="indentv"><b class="calibre1">B2) Making use of a target for an attack on the king</b></p>
<p class="indent1v"><b class="calibre1">A) The file is open</b></p>
<p class="noindent">A well-known issue in the middlegame is the question where we should put our rooks. The minor pieces have been developed, the king has castled into safety, and now the rooks must be brought into play. If the rooks are on an open file, the aim is to enter via the seventh rank in most cases.</p>
<p class="indent1v"><b class="calibre1">A1) Driving away the defenders</b></p>
<p class="noindent">In order to conquer the seventh rank, we want to create a point of entry. For that purpose, we try to remove the defenders of that point.</p>
<p class="game2t"><a id="ch14level1" class="calibre3"></a>Mikhail Botvinnik</p>
<p class="game1"><a id="ch14level2" class="calibre3"></a>Isaak Boleslavsky</p>
<p class="game2"><a id="ch14level3" class="calibre3"></a>Moscow ch-URS 1945 (11)</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00430.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="noindent">In this position it is not yet conceivable how White could invade on the seventh rank. The d7-point is well covered, but Botvinnik starts by systematically eliminating several defenders.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">1.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>b3! <span class="chessfont">♖</span>xd2</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Surrendering the d-file, but after 1…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xb3 2.axb3 White would also take control. Black cannot prevent White from taking possession of the d-file with <span class="chessfont">♘</span>e3-c4, followed by <span class="chessfont">♖</span>d2-d3.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">2.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xd2</b></p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00431.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">2…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xb3?!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Much more tenacious resistance could have been put up with the mysterious move 2…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>c8!. The most important purpose of this rook move is to open a passage for the king to the centre via f8. Now it is not clear if White can actually take profit from the open d-file: 3.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>d6 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>xd6 4.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xd6 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>xb3 5.axb3 <span class="chessfont">♔</span>f8 6.c4 <span class="chessfont">♔</span>e7, and Black is just in time to prevent the invasion of the rook on the seventh rank.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">3.axb3 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>e6</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Now 3…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>c8 does not have the same effect. After 4.c4 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>c7 5.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>d8+ <span class="chessfont">♕</span>xd8 6.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xd8+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>h7 White has accomplished a great deal: 7.c5 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>d7 8.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>c4, and Black is in big trouble.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">4.c4</b></p>
<p class="noindent">White proceeds purposefully. The black knight is the next defender that must be chased away.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">4…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>f6 5.c5</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Right on time, as Black was ready for 5…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>d8. Now this would meet with 6.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xd8+ <span class="chessfont">♗</span>xd8 7.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xd8+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>g7 8.cxb6.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">5…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>c8 6.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>d7</b></p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00432.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="noindent">The aim is achieved! White has created a point of entry and will now have a field day on the seventh rank.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">6…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xb3</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Also after 6…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>d8 7.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xb7 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>xd1+ 8.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xd1 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>e7 9.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>e3 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>xb3 10.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>g4, White will win at least a pawn.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">7.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xb7 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>g5</b></p>
<p class="noindent">The position is highly problematic for Black. Also after 7…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>e7 8.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>d7 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>e8 9.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>g4 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>e6 10.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xf6+ <span class="chessfont">♕</span>xf6 11.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>d6 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>g7 12.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xa6, he will not be able to hold.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">8.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xg5 hxg5 9.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xa6 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>e7 10.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>b7 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>e8 11.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>d7 <span class="chessfont">♔</span>f8 12.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>d6 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>xb4 13.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>g4 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>a8 14.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xe5 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>b3 15.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>d7</b></p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00433.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="noindent">Not only has White won a pawn, he has also put his pieces on the right places for a final offensive.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">15…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>g8 16.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>d6+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>g7 17.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>d4+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>h7 18.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>f6+ <span class="chessfont">♘</span>xf6 19.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xf6 <span class="chessfont">♔</span>g8 20.<span class="chessfont">♔</span>h2 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>f8 21.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xc6 <span class="chessfont">♔</span>g7 22.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>d5 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>b1 23.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>d4+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>h7 24.c6</b></p>
<p class="rights"><b class="calibre1">1-0</b></p>
<p class="indent1v"><b class="calibre1">A2) Making use of a foothold</b></p>
<p class="noindent">We call a square on an open file that is protected by an own pawn a ‘foothold’. This foothold can be used to enforce a doubling of rooks. Earlier in this book we spoke of a ‘springboard’. The idea is actually the same.</p>
<p class="game2t"><a id="ch14level4" class="calibre3"></a>Miguel Quinteros</p>
<p class="game1"><a id="ch14level5" class="calibre3"></a>Fernando Colombo Berra</p>
<p class="game2"><a id="ch14level6" class="calibre3"></a>Omega 1990 (2)</p>
<p class="noindent">Both players are contesting the open c-file. White has the better prospects, since he has a foothold on this file. With his next move he makes use of it.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00434.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">1.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>c5!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">The c5-square is used as a springboard for the doubling of White’s rooks. An exchange on c5 would give White two dangerous pawns in the centre, so Black is forced to allow the doubling of the rooks.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">1…<span class="chessfont">♔</span>f8</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Obviously Black cannot attack the foothold with 1…b6, since after 2.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xc8+ <span class="chessfont">♖</span>xc8 3.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xa6, he loses a pawn. Please note that in that case Black is not helped in any way by the possession of the c-file, since White controls all the points of entry on the file.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">2.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>ac1 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>d8</b></p>
<p class="noindent">With a heavy heart, Black must leave the c-file with his rook.</p>
<p class="noindent">Once again, White’s advantage after 2…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xc5 3.bxc5 (in this case 3.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xc5 would also be good) would be virtually decisive.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">3.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>c7</b></p>
<p class="noindent">The open file has been conquered, and now White invades on the seventh rank.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">3…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>ab8 4.h3 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>h5</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Although White controls the only open file, and has even invaded with a rook, he is not home yet. He will have to find a way to make further progress, and for that purpose new reserves must be brought up.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00435.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">5.b5!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">This is the right idea. White activates his bishop and plans, after an exchange on b5, to tie his opponent up completely with <span class="chessfont">♗</span>b5-d7-e6.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">5…axb5 6.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xb5 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>f7</b></p>
<p class="noindent">If Black tries to trade off the dominant bishop with 6…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>e8, then 7.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>b1! is the most adequate answer. After 7…b6 8.g4 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>xb5 9.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xb5 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>d6 10.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>b3, Black must allow either the loss of a pawn, or, eventually, the doubling of the white rooks on the seventh rank, with disastrous consequences.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00436.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">7.<span class="chessfont">♔</span>c3!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">An excellent preparatory move. The king will be ideally posted on the b4-square, where it keeps the black passed pawn in check, and also prevents possible invasions by the black rook along the a-file.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">7…g6 8.g4 gxf5 9.gxf5</b></p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00437.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">9…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xd5</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Black panics, realizing that he is lost, and gives up a piece. After a move like 9…<span class="chessfont">♔</span>g8, White would be allowed to pursue his plan. With the text move the black player swiftly puts himself out of his misery.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">10.exd5 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>xd5 11.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>c4 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>d4 12.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>g1</b></p>
<p class="rights"><b class="calibre1">1-0</b></p>
<p class="indent1v"><b class="calibre1">A3) Temporarily closing off a file by a piece of your own, with the intention to double (or triple) behind it</b></p>
<p class="noindent">In a position where one player controls more space, he has an interesting possibility to conquer a file. The following fragment makes this clear.</p>
<p class="game2t"><a id="ch14level7" class="calibre3"></a>Anatoly Karpov</p>
<p class="game1"><a id="ch14level8" class="calibre3"></a>Wolfgang Unzicker</p>
<p class="game2"><a id="ch14level9" class="calibre3"></a>Nice ol 1974 (3)</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00438.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">1…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>d8</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Black signals that he wants to start a dispute for the possession of the a-file by an exchange on a2, followed by …<span class="chessfont">♖</span>a8. It is highly instructive how White prevents this plan and takes control of the a-file himself.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">2.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>a7!!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">The egg of Columbus! This bishop can’t be driven away, since Black is suffering from a huge lack of space. Especially the unfortunate knight on b7 is a liability. As long as the bishop is on a7, Black will not manage to exchange rooks. White can take his time to double rooks (or triple his major pieces). Then he can choose the right moment to retreat his bishop, after which the a-file will be his.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">2…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>e8 3.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>c2</b></p>
<p class="noindent">White prepares to double the rooks.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">3…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>c7 4.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>ea1 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>e7</b></p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00439.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">5.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>b1 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>e8</b></p>
<p class="noindent">The rooks have been doubled, but with just the possession of the a-file the game is not won yet. First White must try to open up a second front. Which preparations does he have to make for this?</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00440.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">6.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>e2!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Black’s chronic lack of space makes him gasp for breath, and White can work on the strengthening of his position at his leisure.</p>
<p class="noindent">The remainder of the game (on the theme of ‘how to build on a space advantage’) actually lies outside the scope of this chapter, but it is extremely instructive.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">6…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>d8 7.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>h2 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>g7 8.f4!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">White starts his operations on the kingside.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">8…f6</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Black has decided to build a ‘defensive wall’, which White will have to try to break down.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">9.f5!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">The right decision. White opts for further expansion on the kingside. White is still the one who decides when the a-file will be opened.</p>
<p class="noindent">9.fxe5?!, for example, would have been less good. Black has less space, and with this exchange White would give him a little more elbow room.</p>
<p class="noindent">Also 9.g4?! was less recommendable. In itself, the idea behind this move is not bad, but the timing is wrong. White is better advised to wait with this action, since after 9…exf4 10.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xf4 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>f7 Black would suddenly be able to use the beautiful e5-square for one of his knights.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">9…g5?!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">By closing the position, Black hopes to keep the game within drawing margins. But in fact, he commits a serious inaccuracy, which eases White’s task. Now that the kingside is also closed, White must regroup his pieces. Our eye is caught by the h5-square. His first task is to aim his pieces at that square.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00441.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">10.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>c2!</b></p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="vel14" class="calibre3"></a>Karpov has finely sensed that this bishop no longer has any function on the queenside, and that it is better employed on the kingside now.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">10…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>f7 11.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>g3 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>b7</b></p>
<p class="noindent">After 11…h5 12.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>d1 h4 13.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>gf1, it is questionable if White will succeed in exchanging the light-squared bishops. He can arrange a set-up with <span class="chessfont">♗</span>d1-g4, <span class="chessfont">♕</span>d2-e2, after which <span class="chessfont">♗</span>h5 is a threat. But Black will not allow this exchange that easily; he will parry the threat with …<span class="chessfont">♕</span>e7-e8. Then, White continues with g2-g3. This pawn must be captured, as otherwise g3xh4 follows, creating a mortal weakness. After …h4xg3 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>f1xg3, a knight appears, which covers the h5-square one more time. After that, White can force the desired exchange with <span class="chessfont">♗</span>g4-h5. The consequences of that exchange are flawlessly demonstrated by Karpov in the game.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">12.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>d1 h6?</b></p>
<p class="noindent">With his last move, Black hasn’t exactly improved things. He is making White’s task very easy now.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">13.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>h5</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Thus, the light squares on the kingside are fatally weakened, enabling White to invade with several of his pieces via h5.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">13…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>e8 14.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>d1!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Of course White keeps control of h5.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">14…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>d8 15.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>a3</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Now White directs his attention to the queenside again. If he can take possession of the a-file, in combination with possible threats on the kingside, Black, with his permanent lack of space, will be hard put to keep everything together.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">15…<span class="chessfont">♔</span>f8 16.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>1a2</b></p>
<p class="noindent">White prepares a possible tripling of major pieces. The retreat of the <span class="chessfont">♗</span>a7 is permanently hanging over Black’s head like the Sword of Damocles.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">16…<span class="chessfont">♔</span>g8 17.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>g4 <span class="chessfont">♔</span>h8 18.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>e3 <span class="chessfont">♔</span>g8 19.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xf7+ <span class="chessfont">♘</span>xf7</b></p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00442.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="noindent">An important moment in the game. How can White increase his advantage now?</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">20.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>h5!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">This way White further increases the pressure. The queen enters the black position with devastating force.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">20…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>d8 21.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>g6!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">The move with the greatest ‘paralysing’ effect. Black is completely tied up.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">21…<span class="chessfont">♔</span>f8 22.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>h5</b></p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00443.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="noindent">The last powerful move, after which Black resigned. Both the queen exchange and 20…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>e7 are met by 21.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>g4, sealing Black’s fate. Please note that White still hasn’t retreated his bishop from a7. But nevertheless Black has succumbed.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="vel15" class="calibre3"></a>Karpov worked according to the principle ‘the threat is stronger than the execution’. Because Unzicker constantly had to reckon with a white invasion along the a-file, he was compelled to keep his anti-aircraft guns in their defensive positions. And this allowed White to take him out on the other side!</p>
<p class="indent1v"><b class="calibre1">B) The file is (as yet) closed</b></p>
<p class="noindent">If there is a field of tension between two pawns, a file can be opened. But if a file is opened, that doesn’t necessarily mean that one of the players will conquer it. We will study two different cases, where a file is conquered by means of a small trick.</p>
<p class="indent1v"><b class="calibre1">B1) Doubling (or tripling) and then threatening to open the file</b></p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="ch14inlevel1" class="calibre3"></a>We have seen before that a space advantage can be a favourable factor. For instance, a player who has more space can conquer a file by doubling his rooks on a (closed) file, threatening to open it in the long run. Dr Max Euwe has worked out the following instructive example.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00444.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="noindent">Strictly speaking, Black controls more space. Only on the a-file does White have more space, and he can create a field of tension between the a4- and b5-pawns. In this way, he will eventually be able to open up the a-file with a4xb5.</p>

<p class="noindent">This is the idea behind White’s manoeuvres. It made no sense to open the a-file at this point, as Black also has a rook on the a-file. By doubling first, White creates the concrete threat of a4xb5.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">2…<span class="chessfont">♔</span>c7</b></p>

<p class="noindent">A weakening of the king’s position can in some cases be an occasion for an attack on the king. We know that in the lines with opposite castling in the Dragon Variation of the Sicilian Defence, the white player pounces upon the pawn on g6 to open the h-file with h2-h4-h5xg6.</p>
<p class="noindent">In the following game, the black pawn on h6 is the point of attack that triggers a crushing initiative.</p>

<p class="noindent">Black has sacrificed a pawn on b5 and is ready for action on the queenside. With his next move, White returns the favour, in order to start an attack himself.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">1.g5!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Of course, White does not lose time. He opens a file on the kingside to start the attack. The pawn on h6 is the point of attack that White needs to open a file.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">1…hxg5</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Otherwise the g-file will be opened, with even more serious consequences.</p>

<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">4…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>f6 5.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>h2</b></p>
<p class="noindent">An important point in White’s plan. The queen switch to the h-file indicates that he means business.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">5…g6</b></p>
<p class="noindent">An important moment. Black has managed to weather the first storm. Now White must pour new fuel onto his attack. This he does with</p>

<p class="noindent">It’s always nice to see a player being ‘h-filed’, as we say in the Netherlands.</p>
<p class="level"><b class="calibre1">14.3 Undermining an obstacle</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Just like a bishop (on a diagonal), a rook can sometimes ‘bite on granite’ (on a half-open file). A rook on a half-open file is hindered by a well-protected enemy pawn. This obstacle prevents the rook from invading on the seventh rank. We distinguish two methods to attack such an obstacle on an open file.</p>
<p class="indent1v"><b class="calibre1">A) ‘Corroding the granite’</b></p>
<p class="indentv"><b class="calibre1">B) Provoking a weakness and manoeuvring against it</b></p>
<p class="indent1v"><b class="calibre1">A) ‘Corroding the granite’</b></p>
<p class="noindent">A piece of granite must be destroyed by one of our own pawns. This undermining action is necessary to eliminate the obstacle, or weaken it. The following game demonstrates how this works.</p>
<p class="game2t"><a id="ch14level13" class="calibre3"></a>Carel Van den Berg</p>
<p class="game1"><a id="ch14level14" class="calibre3"></a>Haije Kramer</p>

<p class="image"><img src="../images/00449.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="noindent">This is a characteristic position from the Exchange Variation of the Queen’s Gambit. White’s field of activity is the half-open c-file, whereas Black’s is the half-open e-file. Putting a rook on c1 makes little sense at this point. What use is the c-file to White if his pieces will stumble on the granite block on c6? The following move is the introduction to the correct plan.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">1.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>ab1!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">The start of a so-called ‘minority attack’. White prepares the b2-b4 push in order to ‘corrode’ the c6-point later with b4-b5. Because he starts action with three pawns against four on this flank, we use the term ‘minority attack’ here.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">1…g6</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Black can try to slow down the white raid with 1…a5, but it won’t make any difference if White continues with 2.a3.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">2.b4 a6 3.a4 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>e6 4.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>h4 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>g7</b></p>
<p class="noindent">The defensive plan that Black chooses is to try and exchange his bad bishop on c8 for White’s good one on d3. But we will soon see that this plan has its drawbacks.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">5.b5!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">The white action has developed quite quickly, since Black has invested much energy in preparing to exchange his bad bishop.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">5…axb5 6.axb5 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>f5</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Black has carried out his plan, but in the meantime the pawn on c6 has become an easy target.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">7.bxc6 bxc6 8.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>e5 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>c8</b></p>

<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">9.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>b7</b></p>
<p class="noindent">An important secondary effect of his plan is that White now invades on the seventh rank with his rook.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">9…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xd3 10.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xd3 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>c7 11.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xc7 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>xc7 12.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>c1!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Now that the pawn on c6 has been severely weakened, White puts a rook on the half-open c-file.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">12…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>b7</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Black couldn’t get rid of his weakness tactically with 12…c5 (with the idea 13.dxc5?? <span class="chessfont">♕</span>xe5), since after 13.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xf6 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>xf6 14.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xd5, he is hoist with his own petard.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00451.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">13.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>b1!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">A strong move. After the queen exchange, the weakness on c6 will be felt even more strongly.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">13…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>a6</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Out of sheer necessity Black steps aside, but his pieces are not good anymore.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">14.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>a2!?</b></p>
<p class="noindent">In fact this is decisive. The main threat is 15.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xf6 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>xf6 16.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>b4.</p>
<p class="noindent">In the game there followed:</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">14…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>a8</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Also after 14…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>c8 15.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xf6 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>xf6 16.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>b4 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>b7 17.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>exc6, White would have gained a valuable pawn.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">15.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>b4?</b></p>
<p class="noindent">With 15.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xc6! White could have cashed in a pawn, after which the resistance would soon have been broken.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">15…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xb4 16.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xb4 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>e4</b></p>
<p class="noindent">This also led to a white advantage, but it was converted into a full point only after a tough fight.</p>
<p class="indent1v"><b class="calibre1">B) Provoking a weakness and manoeuvring against it</b></p>
<p class="noindent">In the previous example, we saw that the black pawns on c6 and b7 constitute a strong block against a white rook on c1. By pushing his b-pawn White managed to ‘corrode’ the obstacle. There is yet another method to undermine such a strong point.</p>
<p class="indent1v"><b class="calibre1">B1) Outpost</b></p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="vel202" class="calibre3"></a>In <i class="calibre4">My System</i>, Nimzowitsch’s unsurpassed book, a section is devoted to the notions of ‘outpost’ and ‘outpost square’.</p>
<p class="noindent">A diagram should explain a lot.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00452.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="noindent">The teacher defines the ‘outpost square’ as a square that has to fulfil the following conditions:</p>
<ul class="calibre8">
<li class="calibre7">The square is situated on a half-open file, preferably in the centre, and close to the enemy lines.</li>
<li class="calibre7">There is preferably a rook on the half-open file.</li>
<li class="calibre7">The square is protected by our own pawn.</li>
<li class="calibre7">On the square, a piece (mostly a knight) is placed, which has an undermining effect on the enemy position.</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">In the diagram, d5 is the ‘outpost square’.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">1.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>d5</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Logical; this knight will make trouble in the black camp. It provokes a weakening.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">1…c6</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Black falls for it, and in so doing he more or less voluntarily labels his pawn on d6 as a problem child. If Black had kept defending with 1…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>ac8, we would have seen another example of ‘restricted marching’ with 2.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>d3!. After, for instance, 2…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>fe8 3.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>c3 (White wants to force his opponent to push his c-pawn) 3…c6 4.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>e3 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>cd8 5.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>d1, Black is in big trouble. Here we see the function of the pawn on e4. Black does not manage to get rid of his weak d6-pawn with …d6-d5.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">2.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>e3</b></p>
<p class="noindent">The white knight has done its duty now that the opponent’s pawn formation has been undermined. Now that the knight has provoked a weakening, it can target this weakness, striving for f5 via e3.</p>
<p class="indent1v"><b class="calibre1">B2) Manoeuvring against a weak pawn</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Now that we have seen how we can create a weak pawn for our opponent, we need to know how we can target this new weakness. An earlier chapter – number 7 – has been devoted to weak pawns. There we paid extensive attention to the way in which a weak pawn should be besieged. The following diagram gives a schematic picture of this course of events.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00453.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="noindent">White’s first task is to take firm control of the square in front of the weak pawn. Then he can put pressure on the weakness in the enemy camp with his major pieces. In practice, the defender will experience various problems. His pieces will have trouble protecting the weakness adequately, due to lack of space. A second problem may be that he ends up in an unpleasant pin, as in the above diagram. Here, White wins a pawn with 1.c5, after which the threats of <span class="chessfont">♖</span>xb6 or cxb6 cannot be parried.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The most attractive target on a half-open file is a backward pawn. It is weak, since it cannot be protected by fellow pawns. Another characteristic of a backward pawn is that the defender also lacks control of the square in front of it. A player who has such a pawn is mostly condemned to prolonged suffering on the rack. The following game shows such a siege in practice.</p>
<p class="game2t"><a id="ch14level16" class="calibre3"></a>Paul Keres</p>
<p class="game1"><a id="ch14level17" class="calibre3"></a>Gideon Stahlberg</p>

<p class="image"><img src="../images/00454.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="noindent">White will conduct his operations along the f-file, and Black will conduct his along the c- and d-files. The course of the game will show that the f-file is more important than the c- and the d-files put together.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">1.h4!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">White points his arrows at the f7-pawn, which is well protected by the bishop for the moment. With the text move White puts the question to the bishop.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">1…cxd4 2.exd4 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>ac8 3.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>e2 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>c7 4.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>df1 h5</b></p>
<p class="noindent">This is a weakening pawn move – exactly what White was waiting for. Black parries the threat of 5.h5, but probably 4…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>ec8 was better.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">5.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>1f3 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>ec8 6.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>d3</b></p>
<p class="noindent">At the right moment, White exchanges the bishops, thereby robbing the pawn on f7 of an important protector.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">6…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xd3 7.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xd3</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Now the pawn on h5 is hanging, and Black has to allow a new weakening.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">7…g6</b></p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00455.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="noindent">Bitter necessity. From this moment on, the pawn on f7 is a backward pawn. The f6-square is definitively in White’s hands, while White can use the f-file to lay siege to the pawn.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">8.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>g3 <span class="chessfont">♔</span>h7 9.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>g5 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>f8</b></p>
<p class="noindent">The weaknesses allow White to create threats against the black king. In the meantime it has become clear that the f-file is an important weapon in White’s hands, whereas the open c-file and the half-open d-file hardly offer Black anything. Also after 9…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>c1+ 10.<span class="chessfont">♔</span>h2 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>e8 11.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>f3, Black would slowly get into trouble.</p>

<p class="noindent">In this position, White has several plans. Earlier in this chapter we have seen how White can opt for a minority attack. Here, Black has lost some time by playing …a7-a6 as well as …c7-c6. For Botvinnik this is the signal for an attack!</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">10.g4!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">A totally unexpected thrust on the flank.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">10…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xg4?</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Neither is 10…h6 11.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>f4 appealing for Black. The pawn move would provide the target that White needs to open a file against the black king. After 11…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xg4? 12.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>g1, Black is forced to weaken his king position.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="vel48" class="calibre3"></a>10…g6 was the best choice according to Kasparov. Evidently, Alatortsev was shocked by his opponent’s aggressive approach, which prevented him keeping a cool head.</p>

<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">12…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>df6</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Of course, 12…g6 was crucial, but then White can hammer away lustily on the kingside: 13.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xg6 fxg6 14.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xg6 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>gf6 (after both 14…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>df6 15.h3 and 14…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xf4 15.exf4 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>f8 16.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>h5+ <span class="chessfont">♘</span>h7 17.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>g1 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>f6 18.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>e5, White wins in the attack. 18…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xh5 19.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>f7# is an amusing line) 15.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>e5, and the black king’s position is in tatters.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">13.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>d3 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>h5</b></p>
<p class="noindent">There is nothing sensible to be suggested for Black. The g-file is open and Black is not well positioned to put up an adequate defence.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">14.h3 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>gf6 15.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>e5 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>g8?!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Perhaps 15…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>d7 could be tried, in order to force the dangerous attacking bishop on e5 to declare its intentions.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">16.0-0-0 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>h6 17.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>dg1</b></p>
<p class="noindent">White aims all his pieces at the poor black king, making use of the open g-file.</p>

<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">18…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>f5?</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Black’s position was already problematic, but this move hastens the end.</p>
<p class="noindent">Only with 18…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>f6 could Black have ploughed on. With 19.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>g5! White would then further increase the pressure.</p>

<p class="noindent"><a id="level2" class="calibre3"></a>With this blow Botvinnik finishes this smooth attacking game. Alatortsev duly resigned.</p>

<p class="noindent">White has obtained a rather significant space advantage in the centre. Furthermore, there is a field of tension between the pawns on a4 and b5. Can you conceive a plan that is in accordance with these features?</p>
