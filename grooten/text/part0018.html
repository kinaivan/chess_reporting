<p class="level"><b class="calibre1">13.1 Introduction</b></p>
<p class="noindent">In this book we have frequently talked about strong squares. Almost in every game these can play an important role. A strong square for one player will be a weak (or vulnerable) one for the other. Precisely on such squares, pieces may find the employment they are searching for.</p>
<p class="level"><b class="calibre1">13.2 Quiz</b></p>
<p class="noindent">You learn to play chess by doing it yourself. In this chapter we focus on an exercise on the theme of creating and exploiting a strong square. I’d like to offer you a game where you can try to make difficult strategic decisions yourself with the help of a game of question and answer.</p>
<p class="noindent">To test yourself, it’s best if you cover the text with a piece of paper. You can slowly move it downwards until you encounter a grey bar, in which you are asked to predict the next move. Under each bar you will find a question, sometimes a multiple-choice one. You can look at the detailed solution with the accompanying explanations directly after it. Have fun!</p>

<p class="noindent"><b class="calibre1">Question 1</b>: What is White’s best reaction to Black’s last move?</p>
</div>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">10.dxc5!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Answer to Question 1:</p>
<p class="noindent">This is White’s best reaction. This exchange will cause Black to lose some time, as now he will have to make two moves with his king’s bishop. Although all the centre pawns have been traded off, and thus a completely symmetrical pawn structure has been created, White will enjoy a slight lead in development.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">10…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xc5</b></p>
<p class="noindent">With 10…bxc5 11.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>bd2, Black would saddle himself with an ugly weakness on c5. Also after 10…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>f6 11.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xf6 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>xf6 12.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>bd2 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>c3 13.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>e1 bxc5 14.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>c4, the weakness on c5 will make Black suffer in the near future.</p>

<p class="noindent">12…a5 should have been preferred, in order to maintain his bishop on c5 in any event.</p>

<div class="sidebar">
<p class="noindent"><b class="calibre1">Question 2</b>: What is White’s most promising plan? Choose from:</p>
<p class="indentv">A) 14.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>b3</p>
<p class="indentv">B) 14.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>e1</p>
<p class="indentv">C) 14.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>d4</p>
<p class="indentv">D) 14.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>c1</p>
</div>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">14.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>d4!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Answer to Question 2:</p>
<p class="indentv"><a id="vels3" class="calibre3"></a>C) is the right concept. It is not so obvious to allow the exchange of the light-squared bishops. In general, this will help Black, certainly if the queen can take up the position of the bishop on b7. However, Botvinnik has very cleverly assessed that in this instance, the exchange will work in his favour. The reason for this will be revealed later.</p>
<p class="indentv">A) 14.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>b3 is a logical move, to connect the rooks, but its major downside is that Black can drive away the queen with 14…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>d5, and it will have no good square.</p>
<p class="indentv">D) 14.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>c1 is a perfectly normal move, but it hardly helps White. As Black has slightly less space, it will be pleasant for him if he can exchange rooks. After 14…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>c8, followed by …<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xc1, …<span class="chessfont">♕</span>d8-a8 and …<span class="chessfont">♖</span>f8-c8, Black can neutralize the pressure.</p>
<p class="indentv">B) The intention of 14.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>e1 is to further increase White’s space advantage with e2-e4. This is an interesting possibility. However, with 14…a5! Black can attack White’s strong point b4, after which White’s advantage seems to evaporate.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">14…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xg2</b></p>
<p class="noindent">After 14…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>d5 15.e4 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>5f6 16.e5! <span class="chessfont">♘</span>d5 (16…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xg2 17.exf6!) 17.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>c4 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>c8 18.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>c1, White would also have gained the upper hand.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">15.<span class="chessfont">♔</span>xg2 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>c7</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Attacking with 15…a5 would not have the desired effect. After 16.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>c6 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>e8 17.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>c4, White is clearly better.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00421.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="noindent"><b class="calibre1">Question 3</b>: How should White continue now?</p>
</div>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">16.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>b3</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Answer to Question 3:</p>
<p class="noindent">Now the queen does find a good square on b3, as the harassing move …<span class="chessfont">♗</span>d5 is not on here. Also, the queen strives for the f3-square, where it eyes the beautiful square c6.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">16…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>fc8 17.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>fc1 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>b7+</b></p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00422.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="noindent"><b class="calibre1">Question 4</b>: What is the logical consequence of the idea White had on his 14th move? Choose from:</p>
<p class="indentv">A) 18.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>f3</p>
<p class="indentv">B) 18.f3</p>
<p class="indentv">C) 18.e4</p>
<p class="indentv">D) 18.<span class="chessfont">♔</span>g1</p>
</div>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">18.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>f3!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Answer to Question 4:</p>
<p class="indentv">A) is the correct answer. It is curious that White also offers to exchange queens. His most important motive is that after this swap he will definitively conquer the c6-square for the knight, getting a firm grip on the position. The other options do not meet this demand, and therefore we should dismiss them.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">18…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>d5</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Black does not cooperate, but now he has to make further concessions.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">19.e4</b></p>
<p class="noindent">An enormous blunder would have been 19.b5??. After 19…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>e5! 20.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>e4 f5, the queen cannot be maintained on the long diagonal, and Black will have a devastating discovered check: 21.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xe5 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>e3+.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">19…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>5f6</b></p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00423.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="noindent"><b class="calibre1">Question 5:</b> How can White increase his advantage?</p>
</div>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">20.b5!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Answer to Question 5:</p>
<p class="noindent">An important moment in the game. White finally decides to fix the c6-square, on which he has focused all this time. He leaves the c5-square to his opponent. A few variations in the following will prove that the possession of the c6-square is more important than that of the c5-square.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">20…a6</b></p>
<p class="noindent">After 20…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xc1 21.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xc1 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>c8 22.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>c6! <span class="chessfont">♗</span>c5 23.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>c4, White has a large advantage. In this position, he will continue with <span class="chessfont">♖</span>d1, after which he can try and enter via the d6-square.</p>
<p class="noindent">Here, 20…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>e5 (!) would have been relatively the best defence. After 21.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>e2 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>xc1 22.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xc1 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>c8 23.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xc8+ <span class="chessfont">♕</span>xc8 24.f4 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>ed7 25.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>c6 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>f8 26.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>c4 (this move is better than 26.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xa7, since in that case Black could develop counterplay with 26…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>c2), White maintains the initiative, even though Black has done well by exchanging all the rooks.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00424.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="noindent"><b class="calibre1">Question 6:</b> What is White’s best move now?</p>
</div>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">21.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>c6</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Answer to Question 6:</p>
<p class="noindent">Before Black can swap a rook, White plays his knight to the strong square c6 as quickly as possible. There the knight will stir up heaps of trouble in the black ranks.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">21…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>f8 22.a4 axb5 23.axb5 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>xa1 24.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xa1 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>a8</b></p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00425.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="noindent"><b class="calibre1">Question 7</b>: What is wise here?</p>
<p class="indentv">A) White exchanges himself with 25.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xa8</p>
<p class="indentv">B) White allows the exchange with 25.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>c4</p>
<p class="indentv">C) White doesn’t exchange and continues with 25.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>d1</p>
<p class="indentv">D) White doesn’t exchange and continues with 25.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>c1</p>
</div>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">25.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>d1!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Answer to Question 7:</p>
<p class="indentv"><a id="vels4" class="calibre3"></a>C) is the right answer. The move played is quite deep. Botvinnik realizes that Black cannot do much with the open a-file, and that it is helpful for him to keep a pair of rooks on the board, so that he can derive the maximum profit from his beautiful knight on c6. The best square for the rook is d1, since White can run most of his operations along the d-file.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">25…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>e8?!</b></p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="ch13inlevel2" class="calibre3"></a>For Black it is quite difficult to defend himself, but with his last move Donner simplifies White’s task. After a ‘half-move’ like 25…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>c8, White would still have to determine how to make progress.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">26.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>c4</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Even stronger was 26.e5, since White could then work with some direct threats. For example, Black must seriously reckon with the possibility of <span class="chessfont">♘</span>e7+.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">26…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>c5</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Perhaps it would have been better for Black to admit his mistake and play 26…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>ef6, although this would not have been without consequences either.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00426.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="noindent"><b class="calibre1">Question 8</b>: How does White drive his opponent further into the corner?</p>
</div>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">27.e5!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Answer to Question 8:</p>
<p class="noindent">Now Botvinnik does play this! Since Black cannot immediately establish a knight on d5, White can play the pawn to e5, further restricting Black. What’s more, <span class="chessfont">♘</span>d6 now becomes a realistic possibility, after which White would be able to work with a dangerous passed pawn. Finally, the position now contains several tactical tricks, which will soon become decisive.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="noindent">Question 9: In this position, Black has various possibilities. Work out a few variations after the following options:</p>
<p class="indentv">A) 27…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>c7</p>
<p class="indentv">B) 27…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>a2</p>
<p class="indentv">C) 27…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>a4</p>
<p class="indentv">D) 27…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>c8</p>
</div>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">27…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>c8</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Answer to Question 9:</p>
<p class="indentv">A) After 27…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>c7, White has an attractive combination that yields him the win: 28.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>d7! <span class="chessfont">♘</span>xd7 29.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>e7+ <span class="chessfont">♗</span>xe7 30.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xb7;</p>
<p class="indentv">B) The downside to 27…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>a2 is that the weakness of Black’s back rank becomes a big problem: 28.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>d8, and now 28…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>a8 (28…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>c7 29.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>e7+) fails to 29.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xa8 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>xa8 30.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>e7+ <span class="chessfont">♗</span>xe7 31.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xa8;</p>
<p class="indentv">C) 27…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>a4 28.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>d6 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>xd6 29.exd6 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>d7 30.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>e5, and White’s passed pawn, combined with the threat of <span class="chessfont">♕</span>xf7, decides the battle.</p>
<p class="noindent">After a ‘half-move’ like 27…h6 it is difficult to make out what exactly White should do:</p>
<p class="noindent">1) It seems logical to work with an action like 28.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>d6, but after 28…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xd6 29.exd6 <span class="chessfont">♔</span>f8!, Black will hold for now;</p>
<p class="noindent">2) Since the knight on c5 is the most important defender, we now know how White should go about this: <b class="calibre1">28.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>a3!</b></p>
<div class="breakinside">
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00427.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="caption">Analysis diagram</p>
</div>
<p class="noindent">In this way, White will later attack the cornerstone of Black’s defence.</p>
<p class="noindent">On 28…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>a4, 29.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xc5 wins: 29…bxc5 (not 29…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xc5 30.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>d8 <span class="chessfont">♔</span>f8 in view of 31.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>d6 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>xd6 32.exd6, and White wins) 30.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>d6 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>xd6 31.exd6, and now the double threat of d6-d7 and <span class="chessfont">♘</span>c6-e7+ ends it all, since 31…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>d7 fails to 32.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>e5.</p>

<p class="noindent">Answer to Question 10:</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="vels5" class="calibre3"></a>Flexible thinking characterizes the greatest players. Now that Black has removed his rook from the a-file, Botvinnik thankfully makes use of this.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">28…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>c7</b></p>
<p class="noindent">No solution is offered by 28…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>c7 29.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>a7, as after 29…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>b7, White must direct his attention to the weak point b6. He does this as follows: 30.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>d4 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>c5 31.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xc5 bxc5, and now 32.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>4a5 wins.</p>
