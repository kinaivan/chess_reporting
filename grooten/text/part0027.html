<p class="chap1"><b class="calibre1">Space advantage</b></p>
<p class="level"><b class="calibre1">22.1 Introduction</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Do you know any people with claustrophobia? Or perhaps you suffer from it yourself? It’s actually quite a normal phenomenon that a man does not feel comfortable in small, close spaces.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="vel490" class="calibre3"></a>Again, a parallel between daily life and the game of chess is easily made. Actually, it is logical that in a chess game too, freedom of movement plays an important role. The old teacher Tarrasch had quite extreme views on this: the seed of defeat was already sown if one of the players had to contend with a significant lack of space. Today we know that this axiom is too dogmatic, and we will see examples to that effect later on in this chapter.</p>
<p class="noindent">Still, Tarrasch was partly right. The player who has more space can manoeuvre more easily with his pieces. His space advantage allows him, among other things, to switch from one wing to the other more quickly. The player with a lack of space will have trouble switching. The coordination between his pieces can be disturbed, not to mention certain paralysis symptoms that manifest themselves when he is setting up his pieces.</p>
<p class="noindent">Let’s first take a look at a schematic example, where a space advantage allows a quick piece switch. In the diagram position, White has tried to conquer the a-file, but Black has managed to oppose just in time. Thanks to his enormous space advantage, White can now quickly transfer the battle to the kingside.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00680.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">1.h5! bxa4+</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Despite the delicate circumstances, this is Black’s best chance.</p>
<p class="noindent">After 1…c6, White breaks through on the other side of the board: 2.hxg6 hxg6 3.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>h2 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>g8 4.axb5 cxb5 5.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>h7+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>a8 6.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>ah1, and Black will lose at least a pawn.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">2.<span class="chessfont">♔</span>xa4!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Surprisingly, White takes back with the king, in order to prepare the following doubling on the h-file.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">2…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>h8</b></p>
<p class="noindent">2…a5 does not help either after 3.b5 gxh5 4.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>h2 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>g8 5.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xh5 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>g7 6.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>ah1, and the switch of the white rooks is much quicker than that of the black ones. Another defensive attempt, 2…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>g8, is also doomed to failure: after 3.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>h1 c6 4.hxg6 hxg6 5.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>h7+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>b8 there follows 6.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>ah2, and Black doesn’t stand a chance.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">3.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>h2 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>aa8 4.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>ah1</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Here it turns out that Black cannot maintain control of the h-file due to his lack of space.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00681.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">4…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>hg8 5.hxg6 hxg6 6.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>h7 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>ae8 7.<span class="chessfont">♔</span>a5 <span class="chessfont">♔</span>c6 8.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>1h6 <span class="chessfont">♔</span>b7 9.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>f7</b></p>
<p class="noindent">and the win is only a matter of time.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="vel248" class="calibre3"></a>In many of my own games I can also count on a significant space advantage. This way of ‘pressing’ on the enemy position, which Petrosian has taught us, has made quite a number of my opponents despair as well. Every time I had one of those closed positions on the board, I could hear the comments of my club mates already: ‘You’ve got so much space – you can put two arms on the lower half of the board without pushing over any pieces!’</p>
<p class="level"><b class="calibre1">22.2 Which pieces should be exchanged?</b></p>
<p class="noindent">An important strategy for the player who lacks space is to exchange pieces. That sounds logical, as piece exchanges will automatically create more elbow room for him. Compare the following two diagrams.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00682.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="noindent">Compared to the first diagram, Black has traded off two pieces in the second. The difference is obvious.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00683.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="noindent">In the first diagram his pieces are in each other’s way – especially the bishop on c8 is hampered by the knight on d7, which, in turn, is hindered by the knight on f6. In short, the cooperation between the pieces is disturbed.</p>
<p class="noindent">In the second diagram, there is no trouble at all for the black player. His minor pieces are harmoniously placed, as a result of which he does not experience any problems through his disadvantage in space.</p>
<p class="noindent">To the lack of harmony within the own lines we have already paid extensive attention in Chapter 19.</p>
<p class="noindent">In the meantime, though, we have made an important discovery:</p>
<ul class="calibre8">
<li class="calibre7"><b class="calibre1">In principle, the player who has more space should avoid exchanges.</b></li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent1">In the following game, the white player knows exactly which pieces he can and cannot exchange.</p>
<p class="game">RG 4.2 (C42)</p>
<p class="game1"><a id="ch22level1" class="calibre3"></a>Robert Fischer</p>

<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">1.e4 e5 2.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>f3 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>f6 3.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xe5 d6 4.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>f3 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>xe4 5.d4 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>e7 6.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>d3 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>f6 7.h3 0-0 8.0-0 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>e8 9.c4 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>c6 10.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>c3 h6 11.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>e1 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>f8 12.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xe8 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>xe8 13.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>f4 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>d7 14.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>d2 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>c8</b></p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00684.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="noindent">Black has little space, and his pieces are badly in each other’s way. With his last move he indicates that he would gladly swap the light-squared bishops on f5. After this trade, the d7-square would be vacated for the queen, and the rook on a8 could be brought into play as well. However, White puts a stop to that.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">15.d5</b></p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="ch22inlevel2" class="calibre3"></a>In this way, Fischer increases his advantage in space and at the same time vacates the d4-square for a piece. The alternative was 15.g4?, but that is a much too drastic approach, which would immediately be refuted: 15…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xg4 16.hxg4 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>xg4+ 17.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>g3 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>xf3, and Black has won two pawns.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">15…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>b4</b></p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00685.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">16.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>e4!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">It is often difficult to determine which pieces you want and which you do not want to exchange. With the text move Fischer indicates that he will gladly exchange his queen’s knight for Black’s king’s knight.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">16…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xe4</b></p>
<p class="noindent">If Black wanted to win the bishop pair with 16…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xd3, he would have to allow a horrible doubled pawn in his king’s position with 17.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xf6+ gxf6 18.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xd3, which seems too high a price to pay. But in view of the further course of the game, perhaps he should have gone for that line.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">17.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xe4 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>a6 18.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>d4</b></p>
<p class="noindent">This was the intention of his sixteenth move. Now that the d4-square has been vacated for the knight, White can prevent the liberating move …<span class="chessfont">♗</span>f5 in an elegant way. So White does not allow the bishop swap, and as a consequence the black pieces on the queenside are slightly tangled up. In particular, the rook on a8 is out of play for the moment. The text move is better than 18.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>c2, with which White would stir up trouble for himself. After 18…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>c5, White is forced to play 19.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>h7+, but here this no longer looks so pretty. Also 18.g4 will turn out badly. After 18…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>c5 19.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>c2, Black can again take on g4 with the bishop.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">18…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>c5 19.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>c2 a5</b></p>
<p class="noindent">A suitable moment to choose the direction for the game to develop.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">20.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>e1</b></p>
<p class="noindent">White develops his rook as quickly as possible, with the intention of involving the rook in the attack on the kingside. Due to his lack of space, Black has trouble getting round to the same kind of switch.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">20…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>d8 21.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>e3 b6 22.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>g3 <span class="chessfont">♔</span>h8</b></p>
<p class="noindent">The white pieces have taken up menacing positions, and White now faces the problem of how to increase the pressure.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00686.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">23.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>f3!</b></p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="ch22inlevel3" class="calibre3"></a>Typically Fischer! An appealing move was 23.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>f5?!, but Black has reasonable chances of staying alive after 23…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xf5. Fischer wants to keep the knight and at the same time vacate the d4-square for a piece – it’s yet to be determined which one –, increasing the pressure.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">23…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>e7</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Black realized in time that 23…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>f6 fails to 24.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>e3!, followed by 25.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>d4, which is a merit of White’s 23rd move.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">24.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>d4 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>f6</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Sad necessity, as after 24…f6 25.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>h4, Black could have packed it in right away.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">25.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xf6</b></p>
<p class="noindent">White obtains an additional advantage: the opponent’s pawn structure is ruined.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">25…gxf6 26.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>d4 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>e8</b></p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00687.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="noindent">At long last the black rook threatens to become active. How should White react to this?</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">27.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>e3!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">This move once more underlines how efficiently Fischer approached the game. The black rook threatens to become active and thus needs to be traded off. White assumes that an endgame with minor pieces will win for him in the long run, on account of his space advantage and Black’s ruined pawn structure.</p>
<p class="noindent">Incidentally, 27.<span class="chessfont">♔</span>f1 was a good alternative.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">27…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>b8</b></p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="ch22inlevel5" class="calibre3"></a>Gheorghiu takes Fischer’s word for it and avoids the rook swap.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">28.b3 b5 29.cxb5 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>xb5</b></p>
<p class="noindent">White can always gain the bishop pair, but he wants more.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">30.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>f5</b></p>
<p class="noindent">The principled way to convert his collected advantages into material gain. The knight intervenes on the kingside. By the way, I fail to see what the problem is with 30.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xb5. White then has two bishops in an open position and his rook can penetrate on the back rank, winning a pawn: 30…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xb5 31.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>e8 <span class="chessfont">♔</span>g7 32.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xh6+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>xh6 33.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xf8, with a very favourable ending.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">30…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>d7</b></p>
<p class="noindent">After 30…h5, the pawn is also doomed. White can capture a pawn in several ways, for instance: 31.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>g3 h4 32.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>h5.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">31.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xh6 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>b4</b></p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00688.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="noindent">White had to foresee this move. He has a cut-and-dried reply.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">32.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>g3!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">The right continuation, at least for a human chess player. White threatens to give mate, so that Black has no time to take the bishop. Only a computer ‘sees’ that White can also continue with 32.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xf7+. After 32…<span class="chessfont">♔</span>g7 White saves his piece in a miraculous way: 33.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>d8!, and now 33…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xf4 is not possible in view of 34.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>g3+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>h6 (34…<span class="chessfont">♔</span>h8 35.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>f7#) 35.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>f7+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>h5 36.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>g8 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>e4 37.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>d1+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>h4 38.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>h8+, and Black gets mated.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">32…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xh6 33.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xh6 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>e4?</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Black makes an ugly mistake, which relieves him from his suffering.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">34.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>g7+</b></p>
<p class="noindent">The right move. White wins at least a second pawn.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">34…<span class="chessfont">♔</span>h7</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Neither did the opposite-coloured bishop ending after 34…<span class="chessfont">♔</span>g8 35.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xe4 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>xe4 36.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xf6+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>f8 offer Black any chance to save the game after 37.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>c3.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">35.f3!</b></p>
<p class="rights"><b class="calibre1">1-0</b></p>
<p class="noindent1">There is another former World Champion who also knows a thing or two about exploiting a space advantage.</p>
<p class="game">RL 16.8 (C72)</p>

<p class="noindent">With his last move, Black has mounted some pressure on White’s pawn centre. Now White has three possibilities:</p>
<p class="indentv">A) Maintaining the tension and developing further with, e.g., 15.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>c1;</p>
<p class="indentv">B) Breaking the tension with the 15.dxe5 dxe5 swap, and then playing for the d5-square;</p>
<p class="indentv">C) Breaking the tension by closing the centre with 15.d5.</p>
<p class="noindent">Which of these three possibilities would you choose?</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00689.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">15.d5</b></p>
<p class="noindent">The choice wasn’t too difficult, since this chapter deals with space advantages. The text move turns the black knight on a5 into another source of worry, as the beast cannot return to its natural square c6.</p>
<p class="noindent">The plan under B) also isn’t bad in some cases, but if White had wanted to play this, the white knight should have gone to e3, in order to play for the d5-square. In the present circumstances, therefore, this would not be the right battle plan.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">15…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>h7</b></p>
<p class="noindent">With this move, Black has an important idea, and White must react adequately. Westerinen has acknowledged that he lacks space, and he tries to trade off a piece with 16…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>g5.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">16.h3</b></p>
<p class="noindent">A small, but very efficient move! White does not allow Black to swap a knight, since he could now meet 16…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>g5 with 17.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>h2!. Also, …<span class="chessfont">♗</span>g4 is ruled out permanently.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">16…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>e7</b></p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00690.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">17.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>f5</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Posing Black a dilemma. Although we have established that exchanges help Black, he cannot really take on f5, as that would mean giving up his best minor piece, with trouble on the light squares later on. Another nice example of the strategic question: which piece to swap?</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">17…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>b7</b></p>
<p class="noindent">By giving the pawn on d6 extra protection, Black is now ready to trade off his bad e7-bishop on g5. If White continues with 18.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>e2, preventing the swap (18…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>g5 is met by 19.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>e1), he will allow himself to be driven back somewhat. Therefore he takes action now.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">18.a4</b></p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="vel20" class="calibre3"></a>With this action, Karpov transfers his operations to the queenside.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">18…bxa4?</b></p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="vel600" class="calibre3"></a>If Westerinen had known what awaited him after this move, he would have thought twice about it.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00691.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">19.b4!!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">A magnificent idea, which Black had not foreseen. ‘Chess is not checkers’, is a common saying among Dutch chess trainers, meaning that in chess we are not obliged to recapture. We should always keep an ‘open eye’ for other, possibly better moves. Karpov’s intention is to keep the black knight on b7 ‘in jail’. Furthermore, White can now recapture on a4 with his bishop, threatening to exploit the weaknesses on the light squares in Black’s camp (c6!).</p>
<p class="noindent">After 19.bxa4? Black wouldn’t have too many problems anymore.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">19…a5</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Black is fighting hard to untie himself, by eliminating all the pawns on the queenside and thereby freeing the c5-square for his bad knight. However, it is questionable whether this opening of the position on this side of the board favours him, since his pieces are less mobile than White’s.</p>
<p class="noindent">By interposing an extra swap on b4 with 19…cxb4 20.cxb4 a5, Black would still have ended up in an unpleasant position: 21.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xa4 axb4 22.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xb4 (22.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>c6 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>xa1 23.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xa1 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>c5 24.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xb4 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>d3 25.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>b1 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>xb4 26.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xb4 also gives White a virtually decisive positional advantage) 22…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xa4 23.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xa4 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>f8 24.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>d2 gives White a free hand on the queenside.</p>

<p class="image"><img src="../images/00692.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">21…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>f8?!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Black changes plans, because he does not trust 21…cxb4 in view of the trick 22.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xd7. Now, 22…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xa1 is necessary (since 22…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xd7 fails to 23.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xa8 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>xa8 24.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xe5 dxe5 25.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>g4, cunningly winning the queen in view of the double threat 26.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xg7# and 26.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xh6+) 23.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xa1 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>xd7, but after 24.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xb4 White also controls the position.</p>

<p class="noindent1">We have now seen two examples where a player was slowly ‘squeezed to death’ by small strategic means. Eventually he was brought down by a dire lack of space and counterplay. Sometimes a space advantage leads to a direct attack on the king. In the following game we see how White converts this advantage tactically.</p>

<p class="noindent">This should be preferred above the other recapture. The bishop on b7 is now ‘banging its head against’ the pawn on d5, and later on, thanks to his advantage in space, White will be able to conduct operations along the e-file. Black does not have a shred of counterplay.</p>

<p class="noindent"><a id="ch22inlevel4" class="calibre3"></a>From the game Fischer-Gheorghiu, earlier in this chapter, we have learned that it is important to swap the right pieces. White would like to eliminate a defender of the black king, and he also wants to put a minor piece on e4 and double his rooks behind it. White keeps the threat of <span class="chessfont">♘</span>h4-f5 alive, and with the text move he prevents the exchange of all the rooks, like Karpov did against Unzicker with the move 2.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>a7!! in Chapter 14.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">16…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xe4 17.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xe4 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>e7</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Due to his lack of space and the bad positions of his pieces on the queenside, who will hardly be able to partake in the battle on the kingside, Black cannot do anything.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">18.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>f5 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>f6</b></p>
<p class="noindent">White has manoeuvred his minor pieces into promising positions. Now all that remains is to activate the major pieces.</p>

<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">19.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>e2!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Small moves are often the best! This also applies to this rook move. For one, it is better than 19.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xf6, since after 19…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xf6 White would have unnecessarily traded off an attacking piece. With the text move White takes his time to double the rooks and then waits for events to develop.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">19…h5?!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Another weakening, which is more or less understandable, but cannot be justified. Black wants to chase away the white knight with …g7-g6 without having this pawn hanging on h6, but if we take the further course of the game into account, he should have gone for the pawn sacrifice 19…b5.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">20.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>fe1 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>xb2</b></p>

<p class="noindent">Splendid foresight by the Dutch grandmaster. This was what White had planned when he retreated his bishop to c2. By sacrificing a queen for a rook and a minor piece, White exposes the black king to a combined attack of the remaining white pieces. But especially the factor that the remaining black pieces hardly have anything to say on the kingside, will decide the issue.</p>

<p class="noindent1">As a young man of 21, I visited the IBM grandmaster tournament in the Amsterdam RAI one day. There were many interesting positions on the demonstration boards, but the course of the above game especially caught my eye. I rushed to the commentary room to see if any comments would be given to this game. Soon it became clear to me that the commentator didn’t know what to say about it either, judging by several of his phrases that I overheard: ‘The black player must be tired of life, he crawls back to the three lowest ranks’, and: ‘This does not look anything like a game of chess. It’s more like building with Lego blocks’. But this was a game between two strong grandmasters! In other words, the black position had to be viable for one reason or another. What could a strong player like Ulf Andersson see in such trench warfare? Was it fear? An exaggerated sense of danger? Did he only want to draw with black?</p>
<p class="noindent">When I got to the bottom of this game, it soon became clear to me that the Hedgehog, which is what this system is called, was more than just a fearful retreat to the lower ranks. When I played through several games with this system I noticed that Black was always fully in the game. What’s more, there were a number of strong players who employed the system.</p>
<p class="noindent">By way of all kinds of strange move orders in the opening (for example, 1.d4 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>f6 2.c4 c5 3.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>f3 cxd4 4.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xd4 b6), The Hedgehog could appear on the board, and in most cases Black could play very sharply. In those days Black even achieved a small plus score with the Hedgehog, as far as I could establish from the available data.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="vel151" class="calibre3"></a>It was time to subject the Hedgehog to closer examination. The most important characteristic I found was that a black c-pawn is traded for a white d-pawn, as also happens in the Sicilian. Another characteristic is that there are white pawns on e4 and c4. According to Maroczy (after whom this white set-up is named), White is better because of his pleasant space advantage. But was this assessment correct, looking at these examples? Probably there was more to this cheeky set-up. I tried to discover some logic to it by myself.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00701.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="noindent">Black places a number of pawns on the sixth rank: a6, b6, d6, e6, and sometimes also g6 and h6. Here it dawned on me: these pawns have the function of a Hedgehog’s spines! White controls four ranks, but he can hardly approach with his pieces, since they are always warded off by the black pawns. It’s just what a hedgehog does when it feels threatened: it curls up and keeps the enemy at bay!</p>
<p class="noindent">The picture I saw when playing through these games was that Black lines up his pieces harmoniously on the first three ranks, in the meantime anticipating his opponent’s moves. From the trenches, he patiently waits for his chances to occur, and in the meantime prepares a counter-thrust. By way of a counter-thrust, he has two important options at his disposal:</p>
<p class="noindent"><b class="calibre1">a) the central thrust …d6-d5</b></p>
<p class="noindent">If White permits himself a few pawn weakening moves like b2-b4, f2-f4 or maybe g2-g4, Black can see if the time is right to break open the centre with …d6-d5. If the centre pawns are exchanged and the position is opened, White’s position will contain several holes that can be exploited by Black.</p>
<p class="noindent"><b class="calibre1">b) the flank attack with …b6-b5</b></p>
<p class="noindent">In many games it turns out to be difficult for White to stop the push …b6-b5. As soon as Black has carried this through, and cxb5 axb5 follows, Black is ready to chase away the important white knight on c3 with …b5-b4. If this strategy works, then in most cases carrying through …d6-d5 will not be a problem either, after which the initiative passes on to the black player.</p>
<p class="noindent">Below we will have a look at some of these breakthroughs in the centre. Of course, this does not cover all the problems exhaustively. And you may have noticed that I have painted a somewhat one-sided picture of this system. Indeed, in both cases I have only mentioned the chances for the black player. You will probably get it by now: I’ve started to play the Hedgehog myself! This step was mainly triggered by the following game, which made a great impression on me at the time:</p>

<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">15…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>fe8 16.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>c2?</b></p>
<p class="noindent">With the intention of playing 17.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>e3 on the next move, so as to keep the d5-square firmly under control, and to be able to besiege the pawn on d6. However, the knight move gives Black the opportunity for a slightly surprising combination.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00708.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">16…d5! 17.cxd5</b></p>

<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">19…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xc2!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Black optimally exploits the holes that have arisen in the white position. Note, for instance, the weakness of the square e3.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">20.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xc2</b></p>

<p class="noindent">After some heavy-duty manoeuvring on both sides, Black considers that the moment has come to put his opponent through the mill.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">1…b5!?</b></p>
<p class="noindent">I must confess that during the game, this push was a shot in the dark for me.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">2.cxb5 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>xd4!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Black gives up this important bishop in order to make his way through the centre. The intention of the text move is to force a weakening of White’s back rank.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">3.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xd4</b></p>

<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">3…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xe4</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Plausible alternatives were: 3…axb5, because 4.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xb5?! is not so good in view of 4…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xb3!; or 3…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xb3 4.axb3 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>xc3.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">4.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>c4?!</b></p>

<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">4…d5?!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">But Black does not find the right continuation either. Thematic was 4…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xc4 5.bxc4 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>xc3 6.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xc3 axb5, when the weakness of the c4-pawn will cause trouble for White. Black does not have to fear the long diagonal, since after 7.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>b2 e5 8.fxe5 he has a killer move: 8…b4!, and now 9.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xb4 fails to 9…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>f4 10.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>f2 dxe5, and Black’s threats are decisive.</p>

<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">7.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>e3?</b></p>
<p class="noindent">This costs an important tempo, which is something that White cannot permit himself in this sharp position. There are two alternatives: 7.bxa6 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>xf4 (also after 7…f5, I suspect that the black centre, combined with his actively placed pieces, outweigh the white pawn mass on the queenside) 8.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xf4 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>xf4, and Black will have the upper hand.</p>
<p class="noindent">An outright mistake would be 7.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xe4? in view of 7…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xe4 8.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xe4 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>c2, and White will suffer on account of his back rank.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">7…<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xf4</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Black is banking on his domination in the centre. With 7…axb5 he could have maintained his advantage in a simple way.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">8.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xf4?!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Better is 8.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>c2 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>d6 9.bxa6.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">8…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xf4 9.bxa6 e3!</b></p>

<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">13.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>d1</b></p>
<p class="noindent">White has defended desperately, but after this mistake the position slowly slips through his fingers.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">13…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>d5</b></p>
<p class="noindent">In itself, this is an interesting plan. The rook strives for the g-file. However, there was a hidden win here. With 13…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>b2! Black could have secured the full point. He is threatening … <span class="chessfont">♖</span>b1, and the rook is taboo in view of 14.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xb2 e2+ 15.<span class="chessfont">♔</span>h1 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>xg2+! 16.<span class="chessfont">♔</span>xg2 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>d5+, and Black will get a new queen.</p>
<p class="noindent">Curiously, 13…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xa2? does not lead to the desired goal. White saves himself with 14.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xa2!, and now the same combination doesn’t work: 14…e2+ 15.<span class="chessfont">♔</span>h1 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>xg2+ 16.<span class="chessfont">♔</span>xg2 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>d5+ 17.<span class="chessfont">♔</span>f2 exd1<span class="chessfont">♕</span> 18.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xd1 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>xd1 19.a7, and Black must give perpetual check.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">14.b4</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Certainly not 14.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xe3 because of 14…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xd1 15.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xd1 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>xe3+.</p>

<p class="noindent">A difficult situation for the white player. Black is ready for 17…<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xg2+ 18.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xg2 e2+, winning the queen.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">17.<span class="chessfont">♔</span>h1</b></p>

<p class="noindent1">Nowadays, we know that White is a little better in a higher sense in the Hedgehog. Methods have been found to exchange one of the ‘spines’ (the plans with a2-a4-a5, e4-e5, and c4-c5 are based on this), thereby creating a strong square for a piece with which White can exert annoying pressure.</p>
<p class="noindent">But these advantages are all marginal. Practice has proved that the Hedgehog remains perfectly viable in various forms.</p>
