<p class="chap1"><b class="calibre1">Quiz: open file</b></p>
<p class="level"><b class="calibre1">18.1 Activity above all?</b></p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="vel454" class="calibre3"></a>Steinitz’s Table deals with purely strategic features, but every player knows that in most games tactics play an important part. Also, the fact that in one position there are different factors influencing each other does not make it easier to make a correct assessment.</p>
<p class="noindent">Still, it is good to realize how the synthesis between strategy and tactics is established. Therefore, we must always consider the activity of the pieces on both sides. A player may have a fantastic pawn formation, control a beautiful open file and possess a strong square, but if he goes down to a direct mating attack on the other side of the board, all his strategic advantages come to naught.</p>
<p class="noindent">In every position it is important to look at the activity of the pieces, and how it can be increased – or how your opponent’s activity can be decreased! A piece that is not active should be mobilized in one way or another. Only if a piece participates optimally in the battle, you will be able to say that this piece is of use to you.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="vel462" class="calibre3"></a>This clear-headed impression of things is given by the Romanian grandmaster Mihai Suba in his book <i class="calibre4">Dynamic Chess Strategy</i>, in which he argued that on each move a piece should be developed, and preferably to squares that are available on the basis of the pawn formation. With this thought at the back of your mind, you can try to guess the moves in the following game, where the open file is the main theme. In this game, we particularly have to consider how we can use the available tactics to obtain strategic advantages. The opposite also applies: if we obtain a strategically winning position, we have to finish off with tactics.</p>
<p class="level"><b class="calibre1">18.2 Quiz</b></p>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, we focus on an exercise with the theme ‘activity’. In the following game, you can try to make difficult strategic decisions yourself with the help of the game of question and answer that we also played in Chapter 13. As in that chapter, you can test yourself by covering the text with a piece of paper.</p>

<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">1.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>f3 c5 2.e4</b></p>
<p class="noindent">By transposition, the Sicilian has appeared on the board.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">2…e6 3.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>c3 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>c6 4.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>b5 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>ge7 5.0-0 a6 6.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xc6 <span class="chessfont">♘</span>xc6 7.d4 cxd4 8.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xd4 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>e7</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Instead of the text, 8…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>c7 is the most popular move.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">9.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xc6 dxc6</b></p>
<p class="noindent">9…bxc6 10.e5 gives White an attractive edge, since the d6-square has become weak. 10…d5 11.exd6 is not very attractive for Black either.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">10.e5 0-0</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Exchanging queens would have been a wiser choice.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00575.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="noindent"><b class="calibre1">Question 1</b>: How does White continue?</p>
</div>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">11.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>e2</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Answer to Question 1:</p>
<p class="noindent">For White it is important to keep the queens on the board. He opts for placing the queen on e2, so that his pawn on e5 remains protected in any case.</p>
<p class="noindent">An attractive, rather more aggressive idea was to continue with 11.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>g4. White would also be better in that case.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">11…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>c7 12.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>f4</b></p>
<p class="noindent">This is the best position for the bishop. The pawn on e5 is ‘overprotected’, so that White has a free hand to bring the rest of his pieces into play.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">12…c5</b></p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00576.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="noindent"><b class="calibre1">Question 2</b>: What is the best way for White to continue?</p>
</div>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">13.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>e4</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Answer to Question 2:</p>
<p class="noindent">With this move White activates his knight, which he hopes to employ on the kingside later on. He has the extra possibility of exploiting the d6-square.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">13…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>c6?!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">A dubious move: for the moment Black does not do anything for his development, and he will pay dearly for that later on.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">14.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>ad1</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Of course, White brings his queen’s rook into play as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">14…b6</b></p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00577.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="noindent"><b class="calibre1">Question 3</b>: What should be the aim of White’s strategy, and with which move can he realize this?</p>
</div>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">15.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>g5!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Answer to Question 3:</p>
<p class="noindent">White would be happy to swap the dark-squared bishops, as that way he will create a ‘springboard’ for his other pieces on the open d-file.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">15…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xg5</b></p>
<p class="noindent">A crucial point is what would follow after 15…f6, as in this variation Black refuses to allow the exchange of his dark-squared bishop. The following liquidation is more or less forced: 16.exf6 gxf6 17.<span class="chessfont">♗</span>h6 <span class="chessfont">♖</span>f7 18.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>g4+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>h8 19.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>h5 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>e8.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00578.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="noindent"><b class="calibre1">Question 4</b>: After his last moves Black appears to have everything under control, and he is ready to put his bishop on the long diagonal with …<span class="chessfont">♗</span>c8-b7. What rude awakening is awaiting him here?</p>
</div>
<p class="noindent1">Answer to Question 4:</p>
<p class="noindent">If you have discovered the following tactical blow, you have good tactical vision! Indeed, 20.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>d8!! wins for White: 20…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>xd8 (it is clear that White wins easily after 20…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xd8 21.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xf7 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>g8 22.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xe7) 21.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>d6 <span class="chessfont">♕</span>d7 (also after 21…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>e7 22.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xf7+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>g8 23.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>d1! <span class="chessfont">♗</span>c7 24.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>g4+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>xf7 25.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>g7+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>e8 26.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>g8+, Black is artistically mated) 22.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xf7+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>g8, and now 23.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>g4+! <span class="chessfont">♔</span>xf7 24.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>g7+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>e8 25.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>f8 produces a beautiful mating picture.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00579.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="noindent"><b class="calibre1">Question 5</b>: How would you continue?</p>
</div>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">16.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>d6!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Answer to Question 5:</p>
<p class="noindent">Right! In chess you are not obliged to recapture immediately. It is always good to have an open eye for alternatives, and with this intermediate move White accomplishes a great deal. After 16.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xg5 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>b7, his advantage would largely evaporate, as Black will always get a rook on the d-file in time.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">16…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>c7 17.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xg5 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>b7</b></p>
<p class="noindent">The knight could not be kicked away with 17…h6 in view of the double attack 18.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>e4.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00580.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="noindent"><b class="calibre1">Question 6</b>: With which (multifunctional) move can White increase his advantage?</p>
</div>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">18.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>d3!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Answer to Question 6:</p>
<p class="noindent">With this move White not only achieves domination of the d-file by with gain of tempo, he also forces an ugly weakening.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">18…g6</b></p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00581.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="noindent"><b class="calibre1">Question 7</b>: What is White’s best choice in this position?</p>
</div>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">19.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>d1</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Answer to Question 7: Possession of the d-file is of crucial importance. Not only because this is the only open file on the board, but especially because the rook on d6 will be able to play an important role in this position.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">19…<span class="chessfont">♗</span>d5</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Things go from bad to worse with Black. Somewhat more tenacious was 19…<span class="chessfont">♕</span>e7, after which 20.f4 is the best continuation.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">20.c4 <span class="chessfont">♗</span>c6</b></p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00582.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="noindent"><b class="calibre1">Question 8</b>: What is White’s most promising continuation?</p>
</div>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">21.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>h3!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Answer to Question 8:</p>
<p class="noindent">With this move, White forces a second, even uglier weakening, and also the queen stands very well on this square for yet another reason.</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">21…h5</b></p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00583.jpeg" alt="images" class="calibre5"/></p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="noindent"><b class="calibre1">Question 9</b>: With which combination can White decide the game in his favour?</p>
</div>
<p class="noindent">Answer to Question 9:</p>
<p class="block"><b class="calibre1">22.<span class="chessfont">♘</span>xe6!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">With this pseudo-sacrifice White blows the black pawn structure to smithereens. He will win the piece back with interest. After 22…fxe6 23.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xe6+ <span class="chessfont">♕</span>f7 (23…<span class="chessfont">♔</span>h8 24.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xc6) 24.<span class="chessfont">♕</span>xg6+ <span class="chessfont">♕</span>xg6 25.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xg6+ <span class="chessfont">♔</span>h7 26.<span class="chessfont">♖</span>xc6, White has won (more than) enough material to convince Black to call it a day.</p>
