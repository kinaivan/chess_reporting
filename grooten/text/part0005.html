<p class="head"><b class="calibre1">Preface</b></p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="vel437" class="calibre3"></a>When in 1995 I published the first part of the trilogy ‘<i class="calibre4">De elementen van de schaakstrategie</i>’ (‘<i class="calibre4">The elements of chess strategy</i>’) in the Netherlands, it was received well. In the two years after that, the two sequels appeared, and it became clear that William Steinitz’s <i class="calibre4">Table of strategic elements</i> provided club players with good ‘stepping-stones’ for a better understanding of the foundations of chess strategy. In the mentioned series I made an attempt to give an answer to that eternal question that every club player faces: ‘The opening is finished, how to continue?’.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><a id="preinlevel2" class="calibre3"></a>Steinitz’s table provides us with some important information for classifying certain specific features in a chess position, and to use them to design a plan. In the foreword to the Dutch books, my good friend, the indefatigable chess promoter and chess writer Huub van Dongen, wrote: <i class="calibre4">‘The elements of chess strategy taken together are nothing less than a Philosopher’s Stone with which the chess master is able to find the golden move in a seemingly totally obscure mish-mash of possibilities. Here, Herman Grooten is standing on the shoulders of great chess philosophers like Steinitz, Lasker, Nimzowitsch and Euwe. This lofty position offers him a good overview. He has applied the insights of these chess philosophers to an enormous amount of examples from practice. Beautiful games, which deserved to be wrested from oblivion even without the pedagogical purpose they are given in this book. It’s a joy for every chess student, but above all an homage to the human mind.’</i></p>
<p class="noindent1">These words still echoed in my mind when Huub passed away, totally unexpectedly, in 2011, at the age of 55. With that I lost not only a good friend, but also a mentor, who had managed to win me over to chess when I was a 14-year-old school kid. Huub was not only a strong player, but being an expert in the Dutch language he also helped me with my chess writings later. I have written chess columns for a national and a regional daily newspaper for many years, and currently I make my living writing and analysing topical games for the Dutch-language website <a href="http://Schaaksite.nl" class="calibre3">Schaaksite.nl</a>.</p>
<p class="noindent1">These words from Huub are perhaps too much of an honour for an author who prefers to remain modest. But after <i class="calibre4">New in Chess</i> contacted me in 2008 with the idea to compile an entirely new book on this theme, I was only too glad to start with the job of presenting these strategic ‘elements’ in a new form. The publisher asked me to make a ‘personal’ book of it, presenting training material and training methods that played an important role in my career as a chess instructor. I started working on this task, and the book saw the light of day in 2009. In comparison with my Dutch series, 75 to 80 percent of the book was new, with more modern examples, and also revised analyses of the older material. Also, I was able to present examples I had extensively tested during my career as a chess trainer, with the many young talents I had temporarily had under my wings.</p>
<p class="noindent1">During my 40-year career as a chess trainer I have provided players with quite a few rules of thumb to help them find their way in an apparent morass of position features, ideas and variations.</p>
<p class="noindent">My main intention was to make players familiar with a certain thinking style, which was to help them devise the correct plan and ditto move in each position. This thinking style is elaborated upon in Chapter 3 – in many cases it has proved to be a success formula for the solving of difficult strategic problems. This thinking style, which was new to many, sometimes led to worse results in the beginning. Players would sometimes apply the new information in a wrong way, which cost them points. But after a while, players who internalized this new thinking style were happy when they noticed they had made significant progression. The trainer used to thank them for the patience they had exercised before coming this far…</p>
<p class="noindent1"><a id="vel438" class="calibre3"></a>I have put a lot of emphasis on the classification of various features in the position, while keeping an open eye for special details. After all, a correct assessment of such details can sometimes make all the difference. In order to acquire a better understanding of middlegame situations, it is advisable to train this skill. In each of the chapters, one of Steinitz’s elements is discussed, and at the end you will find four exercises every time. And so, since there are 16 elements, you can do 64 exercises, the solutions to which have been extensively analysed at the end of the book. Almost all of the exercises are strategic in nature, but that is not to say that they do not contain tactics! The difficulty lies mainly in the weighing of various ideas against each other. The most important thing is to spot the so-called ‘dominant feature’.</p>
<p class="noindent1">This is certainly not easy, and we do expect a decent basic level from the reader. But the model examples have been selected in such a way that the theme is, hopefully, clearly visible. At the same time, we have tried to collect a number of attractive highlights from the history of chess. Should the exercises indeed be too difficult for you, then you can also just play through the solutions. In a couple of other chapters you can train your insights by solving a number of questions in quiz form.</p>
<p class="noindent">Put a board before you, cover the moves with a piece of card, and shove it downwards after every question. In this way, you can play through the game and try to answer the questions. You can find the solutions immediately after you have formulated the answer for yourself.</p>
<p class="noindent">Finally, there are a couple of special chapters that contain a profound discussion of a few interesting reflections and ‘training experiments’.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><a id="vel230" class="calibre3"></a>In this 2017 edition, a completely new chapter has been added that deals with ‘control of the position’. In this chapter we discuss the question how a player can dictate the course of the play. The great strategists from chess history, among whom I would like to single out Tigran Petrosian, are capable of controlling a game from A to Z like no-one else. When manoeuvring, they use many ‘Steinitzean principles’ to exert pressure on their opponents. At the end of this chapter, the reader can dabble with various themes from Steinitz’ table, without knowing which one applies where. Like in a real game!</p>
<p class="noindent1"><a id="preinlevel1" class="calibre3"></a>The greater part of the positions in this book have been tested in training sessions with talented young players I have had under my wings – either in private trainings or in group sessions. At the risk of forgetting someone, I would like to name a few names of players who have managed to obtain a chess title at a young age. The best known of them are GM Loek van Wely, GM Erwin l’Ami, GM Jan Werle, WGM Bianca Muhren, GM Wouter Spoelman, GM Robin Swinkels, WGM Anne Haast, GM Benjamin Bok, GM Twan Burg, IM Vincent Rothuis and IM Ali Bitalzadeh.</p>
