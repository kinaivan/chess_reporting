<p class="noindent"><a id="vel553" class="calibre3"></a>Loek van Wely once said of Herman Grooten that his positional rating was much higher than his tactical rating. This is clearly visible in his play and in his writings, and is also reflected in his work as a trainer of such strong players as Van Wely himself and Jan Werle. In my confrontations with these grandmasters I could not help but notice a clear predilection for positional play.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><a id="foreinlevel2" class="calibre3"></a>In this ambitious and well-thought-out book, <i class="calibre4">Chess Strategy for Club Players</i>, it is gratifying to read that Herman Grooten has been inspired, among others, by my book <i class="calibre4">The Art of Chess Analysis</i>. As a player and an analyst I also tend to look first at the strategic features in a position. Obviously, I am familiar with the principles of Steinitz, but this rich book has taught me a lot of new insights and ideas. For example, it was a surprise to read that Soviet players were spoon-fed with Steinitz’s Elements, as in my contacts with them I had never noticed this. In my experience Soviet players never mentioned Steinitz, firstly because they did not have access to a lot of ‘outside’ information, secondly because whenever a ‘Steinitzean principle’ was under discussion they would invariably come up with the name of a Russian writer who had made the same invention. As for myself, when I was a young chess student I didn’t get to know these strategic principles through Steinitz’s or Lasker’s works, but by reading the manuals of our legendary fellow countryman Dr Max Euwe.</p>
<p class="noindent">Herman Grooten has considerably modernized and updated the work of Steinitz. Later developments are also investigated and given a place in this extensive survey of chess strategy. With his great experience as a trainer, he manages to display educational insights that can help the reader increase his playing strength.</p>
<p class="noindent">What gives added value to this work is that many of the modern examples have been derived from training sessions conducted by the author himself. It was highly interesting to read about various experiments he has conducted with his pupils. They illustrate the amount of creativity with which these basic principles can be treated in practical chess. Of course, famous experiments like the ones by Prof. A.D. de Groot have also found a place in this book.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="foreinlevel1" class="calibre3"></a>As the author is also a strong practical player who has participated in several Dutch championships, he has enriched his book with a lively account of chess life in the Netherlands in the past 30 years. The episode in which Hein Donner taught Rob Hartoch a lesson about a knight that seemed active but was doing nothing, brought back some fond memories. Donner’s brilliant account of this incident can be found in his book <i class="calibre4">The King</i>.</p>
<p class="noindent1">In sum, this is a highly instructive book for readers who want to improve their chess skills, but it is much more than that. Herman Grooten has woven a rich tapestry of chess knowledge, science, humour and, above all, love for our great game.</p>
